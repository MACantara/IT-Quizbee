    {
      "question": "What is channel bonding?",
      "answer": "Combine adjacent channels",
      "alternatives": [
        "Channel aggregation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bonding: wider channels. Purpose: increase bandwidth. Channels: 20, 40, 80, 160 MHz. Interference: reduced space available. Trade-off: capacity vs coverage. Importance: bandwidth optimization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a channel?",
      "answer": "Frequency band segment",
      "alternatives": [
        "Frequency band"
      ],
      "explanation": "Channel: frequency range. 2.4 GHz: 14 channels possible. 5 GHz: many channels. Overlap: channels 1, 6, 11 recommended. Interference: channels too close. Importance: interference management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is channel interference?",
      "answer": "Signal overlap problems",
      "alternatives": [
        "Signal conflict"
      ],
      "explanation": "Interference: overlapping channels. Cause: nearby APs same frequency. Effect: reduced speed. Solution: use different channels. Tool: WiFi scanner. Importance: performance issue."

    {
      "question": "What is WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access)?",
      "answer": "Wireless encryption standard",
      "alternatives": [
        "WiFi security"
      ],
      "explanation": "WPA2: security standard. Encryption: AES. Authentication: PSK or enterprise. Current: widely used. Replacement: WPA3 emerging. Importance: wireless security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is WPA3?",
      "answer": "Next WiFi security",
      "alternatives": [
        "Modern encryption"
      ],
      "explanation": "WPA3: latest standard. Security: improved encryption. Protection: against brute force. Adoption: slowly rolling. Benefit: stronger security. Importance: future standard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a BSSID?",
      "answer": "MAC address of AP",
      "alternatives": [
        "AP identifier"
      ],
      "explanation": "BSSID: basic service set ID. Format: MAC address. Uniqueness: per AP. Scanning: devices see BSSID. Purpose: device identification. Importance: AP tracking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is roaming?",
      "answer": "Moving between APs",
      "alternatives": [
        "Access point switch"
      ],
      "explanation": "Roaming: client switches AP. Connection: maintained across APs. Same network: SSID identical. Seamless: best case. Importance: mobility feature."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a mesh network?",
      "answer": "Multiple interconnected APs",
      "alternatives": [
        "AP network"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mesh: APs relay traffic. Benefit: wider coverage. Seamless: roaming automatic. Speed: slower than wired. Technology: modern routers. Importance: coverage improvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is WiFi Direct?",
      "answer": "Direct device-to-device",
      "alternatives": [
        "P2P WiFi"
      ],
      "explanation": "Direct: peer-to-peer connection. No AP: needed intermediary. Purpose: file transfer, printing. Speed: fast. Importance: device connectivity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is MIMO?",
      "answer": "Multiple Input Multiple Output",
      "alternatives": [
        "Antenna system"
      ],
      "explanation": "MIMO: multiple antennas. Benefit: increased speed, range. Receive: multiple paths. 802.11n/ac: standard feature. Importance: performance enhancement."
