      "question": "What transfers data between devices?",
      "answer": "USB",
      "alternatives": [
        "Universal Serial Bus"
      ],
      "explanation": "USB: standard interface. Versions: USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0 (improving speed). Power: supplies electricity. Connectors: Type-A, Type-B, Type-C. Devices: keyboards, mice, storage, monitors. Backward compatible: older devices work (slower)."

      "question": "What connects to networks?",
      "answer": "Network adapter",
      "alternatives": [
        "NIC",
        "Network interface card"
      ],
      "explanation": "Network adapter: Ethernet or WiFi. Speed: measured Mbps (megabits/second). Ethernet: wired, reliable, faster. WiFi: wireless, convenient, slower. Driver: OS software needed. Configuration: IP, DNS settings. Redundancy: multiple NICs possible."

      "answer": "Graphics card",
      "alternatives": [
        "Video card",
        "GPU"
      ],
      "explanation": "Graphics card: processes visual data. Memory: VRAM (video memory). Performance: measured TFLOPS. Cooling: GPU heats up. Driver: software required. Gaming: high-end cards for performance. Professional: specialized cards for accuracy. Integration: many CPUs have integrated graphics."

      "question": "What manages device communication?",
      "answer": "Chipset",
      "alternatives": [
        "Controller"
      ],
      "explanation": "Chipset: coordinates components. Northbridge: CPU communication (high-speed). Southbridge: I/O (legacy term, now PCH). Modern: single chip integration. Buses: connect via chipset. Performance: affects overall speed. Design: determines capabilities."

      "question": "What stores BIOS?",
      "answer": "ROM",
      "alternatives": [
        "Read-Only Memory"
      ],
      "explanation": "ROM: permanent, non-volatile storage. BIOS: firmware stored here. Capacity: typically small (few MB). Purpose: initialization, boot sequence. Updates: possible (flash ROM). Importance: critical for system startup. Failure: cannot boot."
    },
    {
      "question": "What manages power states?",
      "answer": "Power management",
      "alternatives": [
        "PMU"
      ],
      "explanation": "Power management: reduces power consumption. States: sleep, hibernation, off. Benefits: energy savings, environmental. Implementation: OS + hardware coordination. Wake: triggers return to full power. Importance: laptop battery life critical."

    {
      "question": "What stores credentials?",
      "answer": "TPM",
      "alternatives": [
        "Trusted Platform Module"
      ],
      "explanation": "TPM: secure chip storing credentials. Purpose: encryption keys, passwords. Security: isolated from main system. Benefits: malware protection, secure boot. Implementation: hardware-based. Modern: standard inclusion. Importance: enterprise security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What provides battery power?",
      "answer": "Battery",
      "alternatives": [
        "Accumulator"
      ],
      "explanation": "Battery: portable power source. Capacity: measured mAh. Lifespan: degrades over time. Chemistry: Li-ion standard. Management: charging circuits optimize. Health: degrades with cycles. Replacement: necessary eventually."

    {
      "question": "What connects external displays?",
      "answer": "Display ports",
      "alternatives": [
        "Video connectors"
      ],
      "explanation": "Display ports: HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, DVI. HDMI: common standard. DisplayPort: gaming/professional. DVI: older, phasing out. VGA: very old (analog). Modern: USB-C carries video. Resolution: port supports maximum. Multiple: daisy-chaining possible."
