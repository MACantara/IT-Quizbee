      "question": "What performs calculations?",
      "answer": "CPU",
      "alternatives": [
        "Processor",
        "Central Processing Unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "CPU executes instructions. Speed: measured GHz (billions/second). Cores: modern have multiple. Heat generation: requires cooling. Clock: synchronizes operations. Essential: every computer has. Performance: primary factor in speed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What stores running programs?",
      "answer": "RAM",
      "alternatives": [
        "Random Access Memory"
      ],
      "explanation": "RAM: fast temporary storage. Volatile: loses data on power-off. Speed: nanoseconds access. Capacity: GB to TB modern. Upgrade: improves performance. DDR: modern standard (DDR4, DDR5). Essential: running programs need RAM."
    },
    {
      "question": "What persists data long-term?",
      "answer": "Hard drive or SSD",
      "alternatives": [
        "Storage",
        "Secondary storage"
      ],
      "explanation": "Storage: permanent data keeping. HDD: mechanical (slower, cheap). SSD: electronic (faster, expensive). Capacity: TB standard. Speed: important for boot, load times. Backups: critical protection. Failure: data loss risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "What provides power?",
      "answer": "Power Supply",
      "alternatives": [
        "PSU",
        "Power supply unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "PSU: converts AC to DC. Wattage: must handle system needs. Efficiency: reduces waste. Failure: complete shutdown. Quality: affects stability. Upgrade: necessary for power-hungry hardware. Essential: every computer needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What connects components?",
      "answer": "Motherboard",
      "alternatives": [
        "Main board"
      ],
      "explanation": "Motherboard: backbone connecting all. Contains: CPU socket, RAM slots, connectors. Buses: transfer data. Chipset: coordinates components. Expansion: add components. Lifespan: typically system lifespan. Critical: failure = computer dead."
    },
    {
      "question": "What manages heat?",
      "answer": "Cooling system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Heatsink",
        "Cooler"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cooling: prevents overheating. Types: air (fan), liquid. Importance: heat damages components. Thermal paste: improves contact. Fan: moves air. Efficiency: balance cooling vs noise. Maintenance: dust buildup reduces effectiveness."

    {
      "question": "What transmits signals?",
      "answer": "Cables",
      "alternatives": [
        "Connectors"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cables: connect components. Types: power, data (SATA, PCIe), display (HDMI, DisplayPort). Quality: affects signal integrity. Length: matters for signal strength. Connectors: must match ports. Organization: affects airflow."
    },
    {
      "question": "What houses the system?",
      "answer": "Computer case",
      "alternatives": [
        "Chassis"
      ],
      "explanation": "Case: physical container. Purpose: protection, organization. Size: determines component compatibility. Airflow: design affects cooling. Expandability: internal space limits. Aesthetics: appearance matters. Material: typically metal, plastic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What displays output?",
      "answer": "Monitor",
      "alternatives": [
        "Display"
      ],
      "explanation": "Monitor: visual output device. Resolution: determines clarity. Size: screen diagonal measurement. Refresh rate: higher = smoother. Color accuracy: important for photo/video work. Connections: HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What receives audio?",
      "answer": "Speakers",
      "alternatives": [
        "Audio output"
      ],
      "explanation": "Speakers: convert electrical signals to sound. Quality: depends on driver, design. Wattage: power output. Frequency response: audio range coverage. Placement: affects sound quality. Connections: typically 3.5mm or USB."
