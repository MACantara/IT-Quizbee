    {
      "question": "What smell describes classes that use internal data of other classes?",
      "answer": "Feature Envy",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Feature Envy occurs when a method accesses data of another object more than its own data, suggesting it should be moved.",

      "question": "What refactoring replaces conditional logic with polymorphism?",
      "answer": "Replace Conditional with Polymorphism",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "This refactoring moves conditional branches into subclasses using polymorphism for cleaner object-oriented code.",

    {
      "question": "What smell describes objects that delegate most work to another object?",
      "answer": "Middle Man",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Middle Man smell occurs when a class exists primarily to delegate calls to another class, adding unnecessary layers.",

      "question": "What code quality principle states you aren't gonna need it?",
      "answer": "YAGNI",
      "alternatives": [
        "You Aren't Gonna Need It"
      ],
      "explanation": "YAGNI principle advises against adding functionality until it's actually needed, avoiding speculative development.",

      "question": "What metric measures the number of other classes a class depends on?",
      "answer": "Afferent Coupling",
      "alternatives": [
        "Fan-in",
        "Ca"
      ],
      "explanation": "Afferent Coupling measures how many other classes depend on a particular class, indicating its responsibility level.",

    {
      "question": "What smell describes data and behavior separated into different classes?",
      "answer": "Data Class",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Data Class smell occurs when classes contain only data with getters/setters but no behavior, violating encapsulation.",

      "question": "What refactoring replaces magic numbers with named constants?",

    {
      "question": "What measures instability of a class based on dependencies?",
      "answer": "Instability Metric",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Instability Metric indicates how resistant a class is to change based on its afferent and efferent coupling.",
      "id": "cod_qua_cod_qua_d_finals_007"

    {
      "question": "What smell describes classes that inappropriately refuse inherited methods?",
      "answer": "Refused Bequest",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Refused Bequest occurs when a subclass doesn't use methods or data inherited from parent classes.",
