    {
      "question": "What is the fastest type of memory in a computer?",
      "answer": "Registers",
      "alternatives": ["CPU registers", "Processor registers"],
      "explanation": "Registers are the fastest memory type, located within the CPU itself, providing immediate access to data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does RAM stand for?",
      "answer": "Random Access Memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RAM is the main memory that stores data and programs currently being used by the computer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of memory is placed between the CPU and RAM?",
      "answer": "Cache",
      "alternatives": ["Cache memory"],
      "explanation": "Cache memory sits between the CPU and RAM to store frequently accessed data for faster retrieval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the smallest and fastest level of cache called?",
      "answer": "L1 cache",
      "alternatives": ["L1", "Level 1 cache"],
      "explanation": "L1 cache is the smallest, fastest cache level located closest to the CPU cores."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does ROM stand for?",
      "answer": "Read Only Memory",
      "alternatives": ["Read-Only Memory"],
      "explanation": "ROM is non-volatile memory that retains data even when power is off, typically storing firmware."
    },
    {
      "question": "What occurs when requested data is found in cache?",
      "answer": "Cache hit",
      "alternatives": ["Hit"],
      "explanation": "A cache hit means the CPU found the needed data in cache, avoiding slower memory access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What occurs when requested data is not found in cache?",
      "answer": "Cache miss",
      "alternatives": ["Miss"],
      "explanation": "A cache miss requires fetching data from slower main memory, increasing access time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What principle suggests recently used data will be used again?",
      "answer": "Temporal locality",
      "alternatives": ["Locality of reference"],
      "explanation": "Temporal locality is the tendency for recently accessed data to be accessed again soon."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is volatile memory?",
      "answer": "Memory that loses data when power is off",
      "alternatives": ["Memory requiring power", "Temporary memory"],
      "explanation": "Volatile memory like RAM requires continuous power to retain data and loses contents when powered off."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main memory of a computer called?",
      "answer": "RAM",
      "alternatives": ["Random Access Memory", "Primary memory"],
      "explanation": "RAM serves as the main memory where the operating system, applications, and current data reside."
