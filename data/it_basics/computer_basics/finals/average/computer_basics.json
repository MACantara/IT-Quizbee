      "question": "What manages program execution order?",
      "answer": "Process scheduler",
      "alternatives": [
        "CPU scheduler"
      ],
      "explanation": "Process scheduler determines program execution order. Algorithms: FCFS, round-robin, priority-based. Context switch: pause one, run another. Fairness: all processes get time. Responsiveness: interactive feel. Efficiency: maximize CPU utilization. Starvation: prevent process indefinitely waiting."

    {
      "question": "What coordinates CPU and I/O?",
      "answer": "Chipset",
      "alternatives": [
        "System controller"
      ],
      "explanation": "Chipset coordinates CPU-memory-I/O communication. Components: northbridge (high-speed), southbridge (I/O). PCH (Platform Controller Hub): modern term. Buses: connect components. Bottleneck: can limit throughput. Upgrade: limited individual component. Design: determines capabilities."

    {
      "question": "What allows component expansion?",
      "answer": "Expansion slots",
      "alternatives": [
        "PCIe slots"
      ],
      "explanation": "Expansion slots allow adding components. Standard: PCIe (PCI Express). Examples: graphics cards, network cards, storage controllers. Speed: generations (PCIe 3.0, 4.0, 5.0). Backward compatible: older cards work. Resource: IRQ, DMA allocation. Benefits: upgrade capability."

      "question": "What manages memory access?",
      "answer": "Memory controller",
      "alternatives": [
        "Memory management unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "Memory controller manages RAM access. Timing: coordinates reads/writes. Refresh: DRAM periodically refreshed. ECC: error correction (if supported). Speed: matches CPU/motherboard. Performance: impacts latency. Location: typically on CPU (modern)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What handles multiple displays?",
      "answer": "Graphics card",
      "alternatives": [
        "Video card",
        "GPU"
      ],
      "explanation": "Graphics card renders visual output. Memory: VRAM (video RAM) for image data. Performance: measured TFLOPS (trillion floating point operations). Cooling: GPU generates heat. Driver: software enables functionality. Gaming: high-end cards for performance. Edit: professional cards for accuracy."

    {
      "question": "What provides wireless connectivity?",
      "answer": "Network adapter",
      "alternatives": [
        "WiFi card",
        "Network interface"
      ],
      "explanation": "Network adapter connects to network. Types: Ethernet (wired), WiFi (wireless). Speed: measured Mbps (megabits/second). Driver: OS software controls. Configuration: IP address, DNS. Multiple: simultaneous connections possible. Quality: signal strength varies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What converts analog to digital?",
      "answer": "Sound card",
      "alternatives": [
        "Audio interface"
      ],
      "explanation": "Sound card handles audio I/O. Functions: input (microphone), output (speakers). DAC: converts digital to analog. ADC: converts analog to digital. Quality: sampling rate (Hz), bit depth (bits). Latency: delay introduced. Professional: studio-grade cards available."
    },
    {
      "question": "What manages data transfer speed?",
      "answer": "Bus speed",
      "alternatives": [
        "FSB",
        "Front Side Bus"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bus speed determines data transfer rate. Measured: MHz or GHz. Types: system bus, address bus, data bus. Bandwidth: total data per second. Bottleneck: limits maximum throughput. Upgrade: affects system performance. Modern: very high speeds (PCIe 4.0+)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What provides power distribution?",
      "answer": "Power distribution network",
      "alternatives": [
        "VRM",
        "Voltage regulator"
      ],
      "explanation": "Power distribution provides stable voltage. VRM: regulates CPU/component voltage. Ripple: noise in power signal. Quality: affects stability, overclocking. Failure: system instability, crashes. Capacitors: store/release energy. Modern: multi-phase for precision."
    },
    {
      "question": "What enables data persistence?",
      "answer": "Firmware",
      "alternatives": [
        "BIOS",
        "UEFI"
      ],
      "explanation": "Firmware initializes hardware on boot. BIOS: legacy 16-bit (limited). UEFI: modern 32/64-bit (enhanced). Functions: hardware detection, boot loader start. Updates: manufacturer releases patches. Security: protects against attacks. Settings: CPU voltage, fan speed customization."
