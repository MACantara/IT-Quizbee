    {
      "question": "What is a direct proof?",
      "answer": "A proof that assumes the hypothesis and derives the conclusion through logical steps",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A direct proof starts by assuming the hypothesis (what is given) and uses logical reasoning, definitions, and previously proven results to derive the conclusion directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is proof by contradiction?",
      "answer": "Assuming the negation of what you want to prove, deriving a contradiction, thus proving the original statement",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "In proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), you assume the opposite of what you want to prove. If this leads to a logical contradiction, the original statement must be true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is proof by contrapositive?",
      "answer": "Proving P → Q by proving ¬Q → ¬P instead",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Proof by contrapositive proves P → Q by proving its contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P, which is logically equivalent. This is useful when the contrapositive is easier to prove."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is mathematical induction?",
      "answer": "A proof technique for statements about natural numbers: prove base case and inductive step",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Mathematical induction proves statements for all natural numbers by: (1) proving the base case (usually n=0 or n=1), and (2) proving the inductive step (if true for n=k, then true for n=k+1)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a counterexample?",
      "answer": "A specific example showing a universal statement is false",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A counterexample is a specific case that disproves a universal claim. For example, to disprove 'all primes are odd', the counterexample is 2 (an even prime)."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a proof by cases (case analysis), what must be true about the cases?",
      "answer": "They must be exhaustive (cover all possibilities)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "In proof by cases, you divide the problem into separate cases that are exhaustive (cover all possibilities). You prove the statement for each case, thus proving it for all situations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an existence proof?",
      "answer": "A proof that demonstrates at least one object with a certain property exists",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "An existence proof shows that at least one object with a particular property exists. This can be done constructively (by finding it) or non-constructively (showing its existence without finding it)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a constructive and non-constructive proof?",
      "answer": "Constructive proofs explicitly provide the object, non-constructive proofs show existence without constructing it",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A constructive proof explicitly constructs or finds the object being proven to exist. A non-constructive proof shows that such an object must exist (often by contradiction) without actually finding or constructing it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is strong induction (also called complete induction)?",
      "answer": "A variant of induction where the inductive hypothesis assumes the statement is true for all values up to k, not just k",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Strong induction differs from regular induction in the inductive step: instead of assuming P(k) to prove P(k+1), you assume P(1), P(2), ..., P(k) are all true to prove P(k+1). This gives more to work with."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vacuous proof?",
      "answer": "A proof of P → Q where P is false, making the implication vacuously true",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A vacuous proof shows that P → Q is true by showing that P (the hypothesis) is false. Since an implication with a false hypothesis is always true, the statement is vacuously true."
