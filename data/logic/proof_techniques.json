      "question": "What is a direct proof?",
      "options": [
        "A proof that assumes the conclusion and works backward",
        "A proof that assumes the hypothesis and derives the conclusion through logical steps",
        "A proof by counterexample",
        "A proof that uses contradiction"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A direct proof starts by assuming the hypothesis (what is given) and uses logical reasoning, definitions, and previously proven results to derive the conclusion directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is proof by contradiction?",
      "options": [
        "Proving the original statement directly",
        "Assuming the negation of what you want to prove, deriving a contradiction, thus proving the original statement",
        "Proving with examples",
        "Proving using truth tables"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), you assume the opposite of what you want to prove. If this leads to a logical contradiction, the original statement must be true."

      "question": "What is proof by contrapositive?",
      "options": [
        "Proving P → Q by assuming Q and deriving P",
        "Proving P → Q by contradiction",
        "Proving P → Q by proving ¬Q → ¬P instead",
        "Proving P → Q by proving P ∧ Q"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Proof by contrapositive proves P → Q by proving its contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P, which is logically equivalent. This is useful when the contrapositive is easier to prove."

      "question": "What is mathematical induction?",
      "options": [
        "Proving by examples",

        "A proof technique for statements about natural numbers: prove base case and inductive step"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Mathematical induction proves statements for all natural numbers by: (1) proving the base case (usually n=0 or n=1), and (2) proving the inductive step (if true for n=k, then true for n=k+1)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a counterexample?",

        "A type of direct proof",
        "A proof by induction"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A counterexample is a specific case that disproves a universal claim. For example, to disprove 'all primes are odd', the counterexample is 2 (an even prime)."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a proof by cases (case analysis), what must be true about the cases?",
      "options": [
        "They must overlap",
        "They must be exhaustive (cover all possibilities)",
        "They must be contradictory",
        "They must use induction"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In proof by cases, you divide the problem into separate cases that are exhaustive (cover all possibilities). You prove the statement for each case, thus proving it for all situations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an existence proof?",
      "options": [
        "A proof that something doesn't exist",

        "A proof that demonstrates at least one object with a certain property exists",
        "A proof using contrapositive"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "An existence proof shows that at least one object with a particular property exists. This can be done constructively (by finding it) or non-constructively (showing its existence without finding it)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a constructive and non-constructive proof?",
      "options": [
        "There is no difference",
        "Constructive proofs use induction",
        "Non-constructive proofs use contradiction",
        "Constructive proofs explicitly provide the object, non-constructive proofs show existence without constructing it"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A constructive proof explicitly constructs or finds the object being proven to exist. A non-constructive proof shows that such an object must exist (often by contradiction) without actually finding or constructing it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is strong induction (also called complete induction)?",
      "options": [
        "A variant of induction where the inductive hypothesis assumes the statement is true for all values up to k, not just k",
        "Induction that uses very strong assumptions",
        "Induction with more base cases",
        "The opposite of weak induction"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Strong induction differs from regular induction in the inductive step: instead of assuming P(k) to prove P(k+1), you assume P(1), P(2), ..., P(k) are all true to prove P(k+1). This gives more to work with."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vacuous proof?",
      "options": [
        "A proof with no steps",
        "A proof of P → Q where P is false, making the implication vacuously true",
        "A proof by contradiction",
        "A proof that fails"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A vacuous proof shows that P → Q is true by showing that P (the hypothesis) is false. Since an implication with a false hypothesis is always true, the statement is vacuously true."
