    {
      "question": "What method must metaclasses implement to control class creation?",
      "answer": "__new__",
      "alternatives": [
        "__call__"
      ],
      "explanation": "Metaclasses typically override __new__ to control class creation. They can also override __call__ to control instance creation from the class.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_000"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the key difference between __new__ and __init__ methods?",
      "answer": "__new__ creates the instance",
      "alternatives": [
        "__new__ returns the instance",
        "__new__ allocates memory"
      ],
      "explanation": "__new__ creates and returns a new instance before __init__ initializes it. __new__ is a static method that receives the class as the first argument.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_001"
    },
    {
      "question": "What three methods define the descriptor protocol?",
      "answer": "__get__, __set__, __delete__",
      "alternatives": [
        "Descriptor methods"
      ],
      "explanation": "Descriptors implement __get__ for attribute access, __set__ for assignment, and __delete__ for deletion. These methods control all attribute access operations.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_002"
    },
    {
      "question": "What built-in function creates properties using the descriptor protocol?",
      "answer": "property",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The property() function creates managed attributes using descriptors. It takes getter, setter, and deleter functions as arguments to control attribute access.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_003"
    },
    {
      "question": "What decorator creates functions that modify class behavior after creation?",
      "answer": "Class decorator",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Class decorators are functions that take a class and return a modified class. They can add methods, modify attributes, or wrap the entire class.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_004"
    },
    {
      "question": "What inspect function retrieves the signature of a callable object?",
      "answer": "signature",
      "alternatives": [
        "inspect.signature"
      ],
      "explanation": "The signature() function from the inspect module returns a Signature object containing parameter information for functions and methods.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_005"
    },
    {
      "question": "What Python feature provides static type information without runtime enforcement?",
      "answer": "Type hints",
      "alternatives": [
        "Type annotations"
      ],
      "explanation": "Type hints use annotations to specify expected types but aren't enforced at runtime. Tools like mypy use them for static type checking.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_006"
    },
    {
      "question": "What function returns all members of an object as name-value pairs?",
      "answer": "getmembers",
      "alternatives": [
        "inspect.getmembers"
      ],
      "explanation": "The inspect.getmembers() function returns a list of tuples containing all attributes and methods of an object with their values.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_007"
    },
    {
      "question": "What Python construct can modify functions while preserving their metadata?",
      "answer": "functools.wraps",
      "alternatives": [
        "wraps decorator"
      ],
      "explanation": "The functools.wraps decorator copies metadata like __name__, __doc__, and __annotations__ from the original function to the wrapper function.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_008"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method in metaclasses controls how instances are created from classes?",
      "answer": "__call__",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The __call__ method in metaclasses is invoked when creating instances from a class. It typically calls __new__ and __init__ on the instance.",
      "id": "adv_oop_adv_oop_a_finals_009"
    }
