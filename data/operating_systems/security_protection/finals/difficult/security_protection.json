      "question": "What access control enforces system-wide mandatory policies?",
      "answer": "MAC",
      "alternatives": [
        "Mandatory Access Control"
      ],
      "explanation": "MAC enforces centralized security policies users can't override. It's used in high-security environments.",

      "question": "What access control lets owners set permissions?",
      "answer": "DAC",
      "alternatives": [
        "Discretionary Access Control"
      ],
      "explanation": "DAC allows resource owners to control access. It's flexible but can be insecure.",

      "question": "What access control uses roles to assign permissions?",
      "answer": "RBAC",
      "alternatives": [
        "Role-Based Access Control"
      ],
      "explanation": "RBAC assigns permissions through roles. It simplifies administration in large systems.",

      "question": "What attack manipulates return addresses?",
      "answer": "Return-oriented programming",
      "alternatives": [
        "ROP"
      ],
      "explanation": "ROP chains existing code gadgets to bypass DEP. It reuses legitimate instructions maliciously.",

      "question": "What technique detects stack corruption?",
      "answer": "Stack canary",
      "alternatives": [
        "Stack cookie"
      ],
      "explanation": "Stack canaries place values before return addresses. Corruption is detected when values change.",

      "question": "What sandbox isolates untrusted code?",
      "answer": "Sandboxing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Sandboxing restricts program capabilities to contain damage. It limits system access.",

      "question": "What technique verifies software integrity?",
      "answer": "Code signing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Code signing uses digital signatures to verify authenticity. It ensures code hasn't been tampered with.",

      "question": "What SELinux mechanism defines fine-grained policies?",
      "answer": "Type enforcement",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Type enforcement assigns types to subjects and objects. It enforces access rules between types.",
