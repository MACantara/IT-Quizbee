    {
      "question": "What is a computer network?",
      "answer": "Connected computers sharing resources",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "explanation": "Network: multiple computers linked. Purpose: share files, printers, internet. Types: LAN, WAN, MAN. Size: 2 to millions. Technology: wired or wireless. Importance: modern computing foundation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a LAN?",
      "answer": "Local Area Network within building",
      "alternatives": [
        "Local network"
      ],
      "explanation": "LAN: computers in small area. Range: typically one building. Speed: fast (Gbps). Technology: Ethernet, WiFi common. Examples: office, school, home. Advantage: low latency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a WAN?",
      "answer": "Wide Area Network across distances",
      "alternatives": [
        "Wide network"
      ],
      "explanation": "WAN: networks across cities/countries. Range: very large. Speed: slower than LAN. Technology: leased lines, satellite. Examples: Internet, branches. Challenge: higher latency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Internet?",
      "answer": "Global network of networks",
      "alternatives": [
        "World network"
      ],
      "explanation": "Internet: interconnected networks worldwide. Foundation: TCP/IP protocol. History: ARPANET beginning. Scale: billions devices. Access: ISP connection needed. Impact: transformed communication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is bandwidth?",
      "answer": "Data transmission capacity",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network capacity"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bandwidth: maximum data rate. Measured: bits per second (bps). Analogy: water pipe size. Types: download/upload. Importance: network speed. Limit: shared resource."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is latency?",
      "answer": "Delay in data transmission",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network delay"
      ],
      "explanation": "Latency: time to send data. Measured: milliseconds (ms). Impact: affects responsiveness. Causes: distance, congestion. Lower: better for real-time. Critical: online gaming, video calls."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is throughput?",
      "answer": "Actual data transfer rate",
      "alternatives": [
        "Effective speed"
      ],
      "explanation": "Throughput: practical speed achieved. vs Bandwidth: actual vs theoretical. Measured: bps. Factors: network conditions, congestion. Reality: typically less than bandwidth. Importance: real-world metric."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a protocol?",
      "answer": "Rules for network communication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Communication rules"
      ],
      "explanation": "Protocol: standardized format. Purpose: enable interoperability. Examples: TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS. Layers: different levels exist. Importance: universal understanding. Benefits: compatibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is IPv4?",
      "answer": "Internet Protocol version 4",
      "alternatives": [
        "IP version 4"
      ],
      "explanation": "IPv4: 32-bit addresses. Format: 192.168.1.1. Addresses: 4 billion possible. Problem: address exhaustion. Example: most internet today. Limitation: running out of addresses."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is IPv6?",
      "answer": "Internet Protocol version 6",
      "alternatives": [
        "IP version 6"
      ],
      "explanation": "IPv6: 128-bit addresses. Format: 2001:db8::1. Addresses: vastly more than IPv4. Purpose: replace IPv4. Adoption: gradually increasing. Benefit: future-proof."
