    {
      "question": "What is the contrapositive law?",
      "answer": "pq  qp",
      "alternatives": [
        "Contraposition"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: implication equivalent contrapositive. Equivalence: both formulas same. Proof: truth table shows. Application: alternate proofs. Importance: reasoning principle."

      "question": "What is reductio ad absurdum?",
      "answer": "Proof by contradiction",
      "alternatives": [
        "Proof by contradiction"
      ],
      "explanation": "Method: assume p, derive contradiction, conclude p. Logic: pp ensures result. Application: many proofs. Advantage: sometimes direct proof harder. Importance: fundamental technique."

      "question": "What is the exportation law?",
      "answer": "(pq)r  p(qr)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Exportation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: conjunction exported to conditional. Equivalence: both formulas same. Proof: truth table shows. Application: formula manipulation. Importance: transformation rule."

      "question": "What is normal form conversion?",
      "answer": "Converting to CNF or DNF",
      "alternatives": [
        "Form standardization"
      ],
      "explanation": "CNF: (AB)(CD)... form. DNF: (AB)(CD)... form. Conversion: algorithmic process. Purpose: standardization. Application: SAT solving, circuit design. Equivalence: maintains meaning."

      "question": "What is logical minimization?",
      "answer": "Finding simplest equivalent formula",
      "alternatives": [
        "Formula simplification"
      ],
      "explanation": "Goal: reduce formula complexity. Methods: Boolean algebra, Karnaugh map, Quine-McCluskey. Purpose: circuit optimization, efficiency. Application: hardware design. Challenge: NP-hard in general."

    {
      "question": "What is tautological consequence?",
      "answer": "Formula follows from tautology",
      "alternatives": [
        "Tautological implication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Consequence: if pq tautology, then q tautological consequence of p. Meaning: q necessarily follows. Application: logical deduction. Importance: reasoning foundation."

    {
      "question": "What is semantic equivalence?",
      "answer": "Same meaning and truth conditions",
      "alternatives": [
        "Meaningful equivalence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: beyond truth table identity. Meaning: semantics same. Example: 'bachelor' semantically equivalent 'unmarried man'. Logic: includes intensional aspects. Application: natural language analysis."

    {
      "question": "What is syntactic equivalence?",
      "answer": "Same formal structure",
      "alternatives": [
        "Structural equivalence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: symbol-for-symbol identical. Strictness: more restrictive than semantic. Example: pq not syntactically equivalent qp. Distinction: structural vs logical. Application: parsing, formal verification."

    {
      "question": "What is decidability of equivalence?",
      "answer": "Algorithm determines if formulas equivalent",
      "alternatives": [
        "Equivalence decision"
      ],
      "explanation": "Problem: given two formulas, determine equivalence. Truth table: exponential algorithm. SAT solver: more efficient for many. Complexity: NP-complete in general. Importance: practical reasoning."

      "question": "What is logical consequence relation?",
      "answer": "Formal entailment between formulas",
      "alternatives": [
        "Entailment"
      ],
      "explanation": "Relation: p1,...,pn  q (q follows from premises). Definition: q true whenever all p true. Soundness: rules preserve consequence. Completeness: all valid inferences provable. Application: formal reasoning."
