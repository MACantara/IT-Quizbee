    {
      "question": "What visualization technique shows hierarchical data as nested rectangles?",
      "answer": "Treemap",
      "alternatives": [
        "Tree map"
      ],
      "explanation": "Treemaps display hierarchical data as nested rectangles where size represents a quantitative value and color can represent another dimension or category. They efficiently use space to show part-to-whole relationships across hierarchies. Common uses include file system visualization and market segment analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What chart type shows the relationship between three variables using bubble size?",
      "answer": "Bubble chart",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bubble plot"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bubble charts extend scatter plots by adding a third dimension through bubble size. X and Y axes show two variables, while bubble area represents a third. Color can add a fourth dimension. They're effective for multidimensional data but can become cluttered with many points."
    },
    {
      "question": "What interactive visualization allows drilling down into hierarchical data?",
      "answer": "Sunburst diagram",
      "alternatives": [
        "Sunburst chart"
      ],
      "explanation": "Sunburst diagrams visualize hierarchical data in a radial layout with concentric rings. The innermost ring represents the root, with each ring showing children of the previous level. Segments encode hierarchy and proportion. Interactive versions allow clicking to focus on subtrees, making them excellent for exploring deep hierarchies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique reduces overplotting by adding random noise to points?",
      "answer": "Jittering",
      "alternatives": [
        "Jitter"
      ],
      "explanation": "Jittering adds small random displacements to data points to reduce overplotting when many points share similar values. This reveals overlapping points without substantially changing their position. Common in scatter plots and strip plots with discrete or rounded values. Too much jitter misrepresents data; too little doesn't help."
    },
    {
      "question": "What visualization shows correlation matrix as a colored grid?",
      "answer": "Correlation heatmap",
      "alternatives": [
        "Correlation matrix heatmap"
      ],
      "explanation": "Correlation heatmaps display correlation matrices with color intensity representing correlation strength. Positive correlations might be blue, negative red, with intensity showing strength. Clustering similar variables together reveals patterns. They're essential for understanding relationships in multivariate data and identifying collinearity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of chart shows cumulative values over time?",
      "answer": "Area chart",
      "alternatives": [
        "Stacked area chart"
      ],
      "explanation": "Area charts extend line charts by filling the area below lines, emphasizing cumulative magnitude. Stacked area charts show multiple series' contribution to total. They're effective for showing composition changes over time. However, only the bottom series has clear baseline making upper series harder to read."

    {
      "question": "What principle states people perceive visualizations following specific patterns?",
      "answer": "Gestalt principles",
      "alternatives": [
        "Gestalt theory"
      ],
      "explanation": "Gestalt principles describe how humans perceive visual elements as unified wholes. Key principles include proximity (nearby elements are grouped), similarity (similar elements are grouped), continuity (smooth paths are preferred), and closure (completing incomplete shapes). Applying these creates intuitive, effective visualizations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What chart compares values across two categorical dimensions in a grid?",
      "answer": "Heatmap grid",
      "alternatives": [
        "Categorical heatmap"
      ],
      "explanation": "Categorical heatmaps display values for combinations of two categorical variables in a grid format. Rows and columns represent categories, and cell colors encode values. They're excellent for comparing patterns across category combinations, like sales by product and region or error rates by model and dataset."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique creates multiple coordinated views of the same data?",
      "answer": "Small multiples",
      "alternatives": [
        "Trellis plots",
        "Faceting"
      ],
      "explanation": "Small multiples (or trellis plots/faceting) create multiple charts with identical scales showing different subsets of data. This enables easy comparison across categories or time periods. Edward Tufte popularized this technique, which efficiently uses space while maintaining consistency for direct comparison."
    },
    {
      "question": "What color scheme uses diverging colors for data with critical midpoint?",
      "answer": "Diverging color scale",
      "alternatives": [
        "Divergent palette"
      ],
      "explanation": "Diverging color scales use two contrasting colors for extremes with a neutral midpoint, ideal for data with meaningful zero or average. Examples include blue-white-red for temperature anomalies or green-yellow-red for performance. They emphasize deviation from center in both directions simultaneously."
