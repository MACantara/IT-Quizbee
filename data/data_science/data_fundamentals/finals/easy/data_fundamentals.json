    {
      "question": "What is the term for raw facts and figures without context?",
      "answer": "Data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Raw data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Data consists of raw facts, figures, or observations without interpretation or context. Examples include numbers, text, images, or sensor readings. Data becomes information when processed and given context, enabling decision-making and insights."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of data consists of distinct categories without numerical meaning?",
      "answer": "Categorical data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Qualitative data",
        "Nominal data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Categorical (or qualitative) data represents characteristics or attributes that can be divided into categories. Examples include colors, gender, or country names. Unlike numerical data, categories have no inherent order or mathematical meaning, though they can be counted."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of data represents measurable quantities with numerical values?",
      "answer": "Numerical data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Quantitative data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Numerical (or quantitative) data consists of numbers representing measurable quantities. It can be discrete (countable, like number of students) or continuous (measurable, like height or temperature). Numerical data supports mathematical operations like addition and averaging."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns?",
      "answer": "Table",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data table",
        "Dataset"
      ],
      "explanation": "A table organizes data into rows (records/observations) and columns (fields/attributes). Tables are fundamental to databases and spreadsheets. Each row represents a single entity or observation, while columns represent attributes or variables. This structured format facilitates data analysis and querying."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do we call a single piece of information about an entity?",
      "answer": "Attribute",
      "alternatives": [
        "Field",
        "Variable",
        "Feature"
      ],
      "explanation": "An attribute (also called field, variable, or feature) is a single characteristic or property of an entity. In a table, attributes are columns. For example, in a customer table, attributes might include name, email, age, and purchase history."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a complete set of information about a single entity in a table?",
      "answer": "Record",
      "alternatives": [
        "Row",
        "Instance",
        "Observation"
      ],
      "explanation": "A record (or row) contains all attributes for a single entity or observation. In a customer database, one record includes all information about one customer. Records are the horizontal entries in tables, while attributes are vertical columns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of data has a meaningful order but unequal intervals?",
      "answer": "Ordinal data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Ranked data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Ordinal data has a natural order but intervals between values aren't equal or meaningful. Examples include education levels (elementary, high school, college) or satisfaction ratings (poor, fair, good). You can rank ordinal data but can't perform arithmetic operations meaningfully."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is data with equal intervals and a meaningful zero point?",
      "answer": "Ratio data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Ratio scale"
      ],
      "explanation": "Ratio data has equal intervals between values and a true zero point representing absence. Examples include height, weight, age, and income. Ratio data supports all mathematical operations, and ratios are meaningful (10kg is twice as heavy as 5kg)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do we call missing or incomplete values in a dataset?",
      "answer": "Missing data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Null values",
        "NA values"
      ],
      "explanation": "Missing data occurs when values are absent from a dataset, represented as NULL, NA, or NaN (Not a Number). Missing data can result from data collection errors, non-response, or system issues. Handling missing data is crucial as it can bias analysis if not addressed properly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the process of converting data from one format to another?",
      "answer": "Data transformation",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data conversion"
      ],
      "explanation": "Data transformation changes data format, structure, or values to make it suitable for analysis. Examples include converting units, normalizing scales, encoding categories as numbers, or aggregating data. Transformation is essential for preparing data for machine learning and analytics."
