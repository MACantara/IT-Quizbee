      "question": "What is validity in first-order logic?",
      "answer": "True in all interpretations",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical validity"
      ],
      "explanation": "Validity:  f means true everywhere. Example: x (P(x)P(x)) valid. Proof: truth table or semantic argument. Application: tautologies. Importance: necessity."

      "question": "What is satisfiability?",
      "answer": "True in some interpretation",
      "alternatives": [
        "Consistency"
      ],
      "explanation": "Satisfiability:  f means model exists. Example: Prime(x) satisfiable. Proof: find interpretation. Application: consistency check. Importance: possibility."

      "question": "What is unsatisfiability?",
      "answer": "False in all interpretations",
      "alternatives": [
        "Contradiction"
      ],
      "explanation": "Unsatisfiability:  f means no model. Example: P(x)P(x) unsatisfiable. Proof: contradiction. Application: inconsistency. Importance: impossibility."

      "question": "What is logical consequence?",
      "answer": "If premises true then conclusion true",
      "alternatives": [
        "Entailment"
      ],
      "explanation": "Consequence: G  f where all premise models. Purpose: inference. Example: {P(x)}  x P(x). Application: reasoning. Importance: soundness."

      "question": "What is deductive reasoning?",
      "answer": "Valid inference from premises",
      "alternatives": [
        "Deduction"
      ],
      "explanation": "Reasoning: premises to conclusions. Rules: modus ponens, others. Validity: conclusion necessary. Application: reasoning. Importance: logic foundation."

      "question": "What is substitution?",
      "answer": "Replacing variable with term",
      "alternatives": [
        "Instance"
      ],
      "explanation": "Substitution: s replaces x with t. Notation: s(P(x)) = P(t). Application: instantiation. Importance: variable binding. Careful: variable capture avoidance needed."

      "question": "What is the Herbrand universe?",
      "answer": "All ground terms possible",
      "alternatives": [
        "Herbrand domain"

      "explanation": "Universe: all terms from constants/functions. Purpose: reduced semantics. Importance: computational model. Application: automated reasoning. Note: may be infinite."

      "question": "What is the Herbrand model?",
      "answer": "Model using ground terms",
      "alternatives": [
        "Herbrand interpretation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Model: predicates interpreted over Herbrand universe. Purpose: canonical model. Importance: representative. Application: SAT solving. Property: preserves satisfiability."

      "question": "What is resolution?",
      "answer": "Inference rule for first-order logic",
      "alternatives": [
        "SLD resolution"

      "explanation": "Rule: from CA and BD infer CD (with unification). Purpose: refutation. Soundness: valid. Application: theorem proving. Importance: automated reasoning."

      "question": "What is backward chaining?",
      "answer": "Top-down proof search",

        "Goal-driven"
      ],
      "explanation": "Method: start goal, find matching rules. Process: recursive search. Application: logic programming. Importance: query answering. Efficiency: potentially inefficient."
