      "question": "What is a computer network?",
      "answer": "A collection of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, printers, etc.) that can communicate with each other and share resources such as files, applications, and internet connections. Networks can be local (LAN) or span large distances (WAN)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does LAN stand for in networking?",
      "answer": "Local Area Network",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "LAN stands for Local Area Network, which is a network that connects devices within a limited geographical area such as a home, office, or building. LANs typically offer high data transfer rates and low latency due to the short distances involved."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between bandwidth and throughput?",
      "answer": "Bandwidth is theoretical maximum capacity; throughput is actual data transfer rate achieved",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Bandwidth is the theoretical maximum data transfer capacity of a network connection (e.g., 100 Mbps), while throughput is the actual data transfer rate achieved in practice, which is typically lower due to network congestion, latency, and other factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is latency in networking?",
      "answer": "The delay or time it takes for data to travel from source to destination",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Latency is the delay or time it takes for data to travel from source to destination across a network. It's typically measured in milliseconds (ms). High latency causes noticeable delays in applications like video calls, online gaming, and real-time communications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a MAC address?",
      "answer": "A unique hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware identifier assigned to network interface cards (NICs) by manufacturers. It's a 48-bit address usually displayed as six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E) and operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between circuit switching and packet switching?",
      "answer": "Circuit switching establishes a dedicated path; packet switching breaks data into packets sent independently",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Circuit switching establishes a dedicated communication path between devices for the entire duration of communication (like traditional phone calls), while packet switching breaks data into packets that are sent independently and may take different routes to the destination (like internet traffic)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is network topology?",
      "answer": "The physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices (nodes) and connections (links) in a network. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid. Topology affects network performance, scalability, and fault tolerance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does WAN stand for in networking?",
      "answer": "Wide Area Network",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "WAN stands for Wide Area Network, which connects devices across large geographical distances, spanning cities, countries, or even continents. The internet is the largest WAN. WANs typically use leased telecommunication lines or satellite links."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of network protocols?",
      "answer": "To define rules and standards for communication between network devices",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Network protocols define rules, standards, and conventions for communication between network devices. They specify how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and acknowledged. Common protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. Protocols ensure interoperability between different systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between unicast, broadcast, and multicast?",
      "answer": "Unicast is one-to-one; broadcast is one-to-all; multicast is one-to-many-specific",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Unicast transmits data from one sender to one specific receiver (one-to-one). Broadcast sends data from one sender to all devices on the network (one-to-all). Multicast sends data from one sender to a specific group of interested receivers (one-to-many-specific), more efficient than broadcast."
