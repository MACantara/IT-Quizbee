    {
      "question": "An operating system that executes jobs in groups without user interaction during processing.",
      "answer": "Batch processing system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Batch system",
        "Batch OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Batch processing systems group similar jobs and execute them sequentially without requiring user interaction during execution. Jobs are submitted, queued, and processed in batches.",

    },
    {
      "question": "An operating system that allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously by rapidly switching the CPU between them.",
      "answer": "Time-sharing system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Time-sharing OS",
        "Multitasking system"
      ],
      "explanation": "Time-sharing systems enable multiple users to use the computer concurrently by giving each user a small time slice. The rapid switching creates the illusion that each user has dedicated access.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_001"
    },
    {
      "question": "An operating system that must meet timing deadlines without exception, often used in critical control systems.",
      "answer": "Real-time operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Real-time system",
        "RTOS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Real-time operating systems must respond to events within strict time constraints. They are used in applications where timing is critical, such as industrial control, medical devices, and avionics.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_002"
    },
    {
      "question": "An operating system that coordinates multiple independent computers connected by a network to appear as a single system.",
      "answer": "Distributed operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Distributed system",
        "Distributed OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Distributed operating systems make a collection of networked computers appear as a single coherent system. Resources are shared transparently across the network without users knowing the physical location.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_003"
    },
    {
      "question": "An operating system designed for devices with limited resources that performs specific dedicated tasks.",
      "answer": "Embedded operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Embedded system",
        "Embedded OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Embedded operating systems are specialized for devices with constrained resources like routers, appliances, and sensors. They are optimized for efficiency and specific functions rather than general-purpose computing.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_004"
    },
    {
      "question": "An operating system where users are explicitly aware of multiple networked machines and must manually access remote resources.",
      "answer": "Network operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network OS",
        "NOS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Network operating systems allow computers to share resources over a network, but users are aware of the network structure and must explicitly access remote resources. Examples include early Windows Server and Novell NetWare.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_005"

    {
      "question": "An operating system optimized for handling multiple client requests and providing network services.",
      "answer": "Server operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Server OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Server operating systems are designed to efficiently handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously. They emphasize stability, security, and resource management for services like web hosting, file sharing, and databases.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_006"

      "question": "An operating system designed for smartphones and tablets with touch interfaces and power efficiency.",
      "answer": "Mobile operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Mobile OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mobile operating systems are designed for portable devices with touchscreens. They prioritize power management, mobile connectivity, and app ecosystems. Examples include Android and iOS.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_007"
    },
    {
      "question": "An operating system that manages multiple processors within a single computer system.",
      "answer": "Multiprocessor operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Multiprocessor OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Multiprocessor operating systems coordinate multiple CPUs within a single machine. They handle load balancing, processor synchronization, and parallel task execution to improve performance.",
      "id": "os_typ_os_typ_e_finals_008"

      "question": "An operating system designed for personal computers with user-friendly interfaces for individual users.",
      "answer": "Desktop operating system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Desktop OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Desktop operating systems are designed for personal computers used by individual users. They provide graphical interfaces, support for productivity applications, and multimedia capabilities. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop distributions.",
