    {
      "question": "What is subnetting?",
      "answer": "Dividing IP address space",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network division"
      ],
      "explanation": "Subnetting: split network. Method: borrow bits from host. Subnet mask: defines boundaries. Example: 192.168.1.0/24. Benefit: organization, security. Complexity: calculation needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)?",
      "answer": "Flexible IP addressing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Flexible addressing"
      ],
      "explanation": "CIDR: variable subnet masks. Notation: /24 indicates mask. Efficiency: better address utilization. Routing: aggregation possible. Example: 192.168.0.0/22. Importance: modern addressing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is default gateway?",
      "answer": "Router for leaving local network",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network gateway"
      ],
      "explanation": "Gateway: IP address of router. Function: forwards packets to other networks. Configuration: each device needs. Importance: reaching outside network. Typical: 192.168.1.1."

      "question": "What is DHCP?",
      "answer": "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "IP assignment"
      ],
      "explanation": "DHCP: automatic IP allocation. Process: DORA (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge). Lease: temporary assignment. Benefit: simplifies administration. Alternative: static assignment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a DHCP lease?",
      "answer": "Time-limited IP address",
      "alternatives": [
        "IP duration"
      ],
      "explanation": "Lease: fixed duration. Renewal: typically at 50% or 87.5%. Expiration: IP returned if not renewed. TTL: time-to-live. Purpose: IP reuse. Default: 24 hours often."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is SNMP?",
      "answer": "Simple Network Management Protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network management"
      ],
      "explanation": "SNMP: monitor network devices. Agents: on devices. Manager: collects data. Community: authentication method. Versions: v1, v2c, v3. Importance: monitoring critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a MIB?",
      "answer": "Management Information Base",
      "alternatives": [
        "Device database"
      ],
      "explanation": "MIB: repository of managed objects. Organization: tree structure. OID: object identifier. Purpose: SNMP queries. Example: sysUpTime. Importance: standardization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is NTP?",
      "answer": "Network Time Protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Time synchronization"
      ],
      "explanation": "NTP: synchronizes clocks. Accuracy: milliseconds. Stratum: hierarchy of servers. Purpose: coordination, logging. Port: 123 (UDP). Importance: essential for security."

    {
      "question": "What is a proxy server?",
      "answer": "Intermediary for requests",
      "alternatives": [
        "Request intermediary"
      ],
      "explanation": "Proxy: acts on behalf of clients. Function: forward requests, cache responses. Benefits: security, performance, privacy. Types: forward, reverse. Importance: enterprise use."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a reverse proxy?",
      "answer": "Intermediary for servers",
      "alternatives": [
        "Server intermediary"
      ],
      "explanation": "Reverse proxy: front-end to servers. Function: load balancing, caching, security. Example: nginx, Apache. Benefit: server protection. Usage: web servers common."
