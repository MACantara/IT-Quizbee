    {
      "question": "What is the primary component of a computer that performs arithmetic and logical operations?",
      "answer": "CPU (Central Processing Unit)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Central Processing Unit",
        "Processor",
        "Microprocessor"
      ],
      "explanation": "The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It contains the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for mathematical operations and the Control Unit (CU) for managing instruction execution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the small, fast memory located inside the CPU that stores frequently accessed data and instructions?",
      "answer": "Cache",
      "alternatives": [
        "CPU Cache",
        "Cache Memory"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cache memory is a high-speed memory located directly on the CPU chip. It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the time needed to access them from main memory (RAM), significantly improving processing speed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What component of the CPU is responsible for performing mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division?",
      "answer": "ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Arithmetic Logic Unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "The ALU is a fundamental component of the CPU that performs all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, comparisons). It's the computational heart of the processor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do we call the number of bits a CPU can process at one time?",
      "answer": "Word Size",
      "alternatives": [
        "Processor Word Size",
        "Data Width",
        "Bit Width"
      ],
      "explanation": "Word size refers to the number of bits that a CPU can process simultaneously in a single operation. Common word sizes include 32-bit and 64-bit, which determine how much data can be processed at once and how much memory can be addressed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for the speed at which a CPU executes instructions, typically measured in GHz?",
      "answer": "Clock Speed",
      "alternatives": [
        "Clock Frequency",
        "Clock Rate",
        "Processor Speed"
      ],
      "explanation": "Clock speed, measured in Gigahertz (GHz), indicates how many instruction cycles a CPU can execute per second. A higher clock speed generally means faster processing, though modern performance also depends on architecture, cores, and cache."
    },
    {
      "question": "What component manages the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and other components?",
      "answer": "Control Unit",
      "alternatives": [
        "CU",
        "CPU Control Unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Control Unit coordinates all CPU operations by fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and directing other components to execute them. It acts as the traffic controller of the CPU, managing the fetch-decode-execute cycle."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the temporary storage locations inside the CPU used during instruction execution?",
      "answer": "Registers",
      "alternatives": [
        "CPU Registers",
        "Processor Registers"
      ],
      "explanation": "Registers are the fastest type of memory in a computer, located directly inside the CPU. They temporarily hold data, addresses, and instructions during processing. Examples include the accumulator, program counter, and instruction register."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technology allows a single CPU chip to contain multiple processing units that can execute instructions independently?",
      "answer": "Multi-core",
      "alternatives": [
        "Multiple Cores",
        "Multi-core Technology",
        "Multicore"
      ],
      "explanation": "Multi-core processors contain two or more independent CPU cores on a single chip, allowing parallel execution of multiple tasks. This improves performance for multitasking and multi-threaded applications without increasing clock speed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the register that keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction to be executed?",
      "answer": "Program Counter",
      "alternatives": [
        "PC",
        "Instruction Pointer",
        "IP"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Program Counter (PC) is a special register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed. After each instruction, it automatically increments to point to the next instruction in sequence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What architectural feature allows a CPU to execute multiple instructions simultaneously by overlapping their execution stages?",
      "answer": "Pipelining",
      "alternatives": [
        "Instruction Pipelining",
        "Pipeline"
      ],
      "explanation": "Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped during execution, similar to an assembly line. While one instruction is being decoded, another is being fetched, and another is being executed, improving overall throughput."
