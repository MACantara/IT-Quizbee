      "alternatives": [
        "Nand symbol"
      ],
      "explanation": "Sheffer: p|q = NAND. Definition: (pq). Complete: alone sufficient. Boolean algebra: algebraic structure. Laws: apply to Sheffer operations. Proof: complex formulas. Historical: early notation."

      "alternatives": [
        "Nor symbol"
      ],
      "explanation": "Peirce: pq = NOR. Definition: (pq). Complete: alone sufficient. Duality: relates to Sheffer. Boolean algebra: operates with NOR. Simplification: complex. Historical: alternative notation."

      "question": "What is material implication?",
      "answer": "Standard logical implication ()",
      "alternatives": [
        "Conditional operator"
      ],
      "explanation": "Material: pq equivalent pq. Truth: false only p true, q false. Controversy: captures everyday meaning. Logic: formal definition. Paradox: odd results (vacuous truth). Importance: reasoning basis."

      "question": "What is material equivalence?",
      "answer": "Biconditional ()",
      "alternatives": [
        "If and only if"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: pq true when same truth value. Definition: (pq)(qp). Symmetric: pq  qp. Truth conditions: both true or both false. Applications: definitions, specifications. Importance: central to mathematics."

      "question": "What is the stroke operator?",
      "answer": "Binary connective for operations",
      "alternatives": [
        "Operator notation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Stroke: general notation op(p,q). Sheffer: special case (NAND). Flexibility: represent any operator. Truth function: 2^(2^n) possible. Classification: unary, binary, higher. Purpose: systematic notation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are unary operators?",
      "answer": "Operators with one operand",
      "alternatives": [
        "Single operand"
      ],
      "explanation": "Unary: operates on single proposition. Examples: NOT (), other negation variants. Count: 4 possible unary operators (2^2). Common: only NOT widely used. Truth functions: identity, negation, constant. Notation: prefix."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are binary operators?",
      "answer": "Operators with two operands",
      "alternatives": [
        "Two operands"

      "explanation": "Binary: operates on two propositions. Examples: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, , . Count: 16 possible binary operators (2^4). Common: AND, OR, XOR, , . Truth functions: all 16 variants exist. Notation: infix."

      "question": "What is the truth function?",
      "answer": "Mapping inputs to outputs",
      "alternatives": [
        "Input-output function"
      ],
      "explanation": "Function: given inputs, produces output. Inputs: propositions (true/false). Output: result value. Definition: complete truth table. Operators: each has truth function. Completeness: 2^(2^n) functions for n variables. Computation: truth table evaluation."

      "question": "What is a truth condition?",
      "answer": "When statement is true",
      "alternatives": [
        "True conditions"
      ],
      "explanation": "Condition: specifies truth circumstances. Statement: specific formula. Truth table: all conditions listed. Explicit: necessary for clarity. Example: pq true when both true. Importance: understanding meaning."

      "question": "What is operator overloading?",
      "answer": "Symbol with multiple meanings",
      "alternatives": [
        "Notation ambiguity"
      ],
      "explanation": "Overload: same symbol, different contexts. Example: + (arithmetic, string concatenation). Logic: generally avoided. Confusion: prevents misinterpretation. Clarity: explicit operator preferred. Solutions: parentheses, context."
