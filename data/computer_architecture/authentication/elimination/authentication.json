      "explanation": "Authentication is the process of confirming that someone or something is who they claim to be before granting access."

        "Fingerprint",
        "Username"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Physical devices like security tokens, smart cards, or smartphones represent possession-based authentication factors."

      "question": "What authentication factor is 'something you are'?",
      "options": [
        "Biometric data like fingerprints",

        "ID card",
        "Security question"

      "options": [
        "Using only a password",

        "Having multiple passwords",
        "Logging in from multiple devices"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "MFA requires two or more different types of authentication factors, significantly enhancing security beyond single-factor authentication."

      "options": [
        "Two passwords",

        "Two security questions",
        "Two usernames"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "2FA requires two distinct authentication factors, typically combining something you know with something you have or are."

        "Using one password for everything",

        "Only one person can log in",
        "Single-factor authentication"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "SSO allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple related systems without re-entering credentials."

      "question": "What is a one-time password (OTP)?",
      "options": [
        "A permanent password",

        "The first password you create",
        "A password used once per day"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "OTPs are temporary passwords valid for a single login session or transaction, enhancing security by preventing reuse."

    {
      "question": "What is the main weakness of password-only authentication?",
      "options": [
        "Too expensive",
        "Vulnerable to theft, guessing, and phishing",
        "Too slow",
        "Requires special hardware"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Passwords can be stolen, guessed through brute force attacks, or obtained through phishing, making them weak when used alone."

      "question": "What is OAuth primarily used for?",
      "options": [
        "Encrypting files",
        "Authorizing third-party access without sharing passwords",
