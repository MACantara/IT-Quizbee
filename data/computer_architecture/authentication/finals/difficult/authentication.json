    {
      "question": "What password hashing algorithm is designed to be slow and resistant to hardware attacks?",
      "answer": "bcrypt",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bcrypt",
        "bcrypt hashing"
      ],
      "explanation": "bcrypt uses adaptive hashing with a work factor to intentionally slow down hashing, making brute force attacks impractical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication standard uses public key cryptography for passwordless login?",
      "answer": "FIDO2",
      "alternatives": [
        "WebAuthn",
        "Fast Identity Online",
        "FIDO"
      ],
      "explanation": "FIDO2 enables strong, phishing-resistant authentication using public-key cryptography instead of passwords."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol authenticates users based on challenge-response without sending passwords?",
      "answer": "CHAP",
      "alternatives": [
        "Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol",
        "Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "CHAP uses a three-way handshake where the server sends a challenge and verifies the hashed response."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the memory-hard password hashing algorithm recommended for new applications?",
      "answer": "Argon2",
      "alternatives": [
        "Argon2id",
        "Argon 2"
      ],
      "explanation": "Argon2 won the Password Hashing Competition and resists both GPU and ASIC attacks through memory-intensive operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication factor measures behavioral patterns like typing rhythm?",
      "answer": "Behavioral biometrics",
      "alternatives": [
        "Behavioral authentication",
        "Keystroke dynamics",
        "Behavioural biometrics"
      ],
      "explanation": "Behavioral biometrics analyze unique patterns in user behavior like typing speed, mouse movements, or gait for continuous authentication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack exploits authentication tokens that don't expire properly?",
      "answer": "Session fixation",
      "alternatives": [
        "Token fixation",
        "Session fixation attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "Session fixation forces a user's session ID to a known value, allowing attackers to hijack authenticated sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol provides mutual authentication for wireless networks?",
      "answer": "EAP-TLS",
      "alternatives": [
        "Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security",
        "EAP TLS"
      ],
      "explanation": "EAP-TLS uses digital certificates for both client and server authentication, providing the strongest wireless security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication technique analyzes physical card characteristics to prevent cloning?",
      "answer": "EMV",
      "alternatives": [
        "Chip and PIN",
        "Europay Mastercard Visa",
        "Smart card"
      ],
      "explanation": "EMV chip technology authenticates cards using cryptographic methods that are nearly impossible to clone, unlike magnetic stripes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack intercepts authentication credentials during the protocol exchange?",
      "answer": "Pass-the-hash",
      "alternatives": [
        "PtH",
        "Pass the hash attack",
        "Hash passing"
      ],
      "explanation": "Pass-the-hash attacks use captured password hashes to authenticate without knowing the actual password."
    },
    {
      "question": "What zero-trust authentication approach continuously verifies user identity and context?",
      "answer": "Risk-based authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Adaptive authentication",
        "Context-aware authentication",
        "Continuous authentication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Risk-based authentication dynamically adjusts security requirements based on user behavior, location, device, and other risk factors."
