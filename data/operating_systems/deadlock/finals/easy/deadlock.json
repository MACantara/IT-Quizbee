    {
      "question": "What occurs when processes wait indefinitely for resources?",
      "answer": "Deadlock",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Deadlock is a state where processes permanently wait for resources held by other waiting processes. External intervention is required.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_000"
    },
    {
      "question": "What deadlock condition means only one process can use a resource?",
      "answer": "Mutual exclusion",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Mutual exclusion requires exclusive resource access. While necessary for correctness, it enables deadlock.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_001"
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition means processes hold resources while requesting more?",
      "answer": "Hold and wait",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Hold and wait allows processes to retain resources while waiting for others. It's one of four deadlock conditions.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_002"
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition prevents forcible resource removal?",
      "answer": "No preemption",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "No preemption means resources can't be forcibly taken. Processes must release resources voluntarily.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_003"
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition forms a resource waiting cycle?",
      "answer": "Circular wait",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Circular wait creates a closed chain of processes each waiting for the next. It's necessary for deadlock.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_004"
    },
    {
      "question": "What graph shows resource allocation and requests?",
      "answer": "Resource allocation graph",
      "alternatives": [
        "RAG"
      ],
      "explanation": "Resource allocation graphs visualize processes, resources, and their relationships. Cycles indicate potential deadlock.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_005"
    },
    {
      "question": "What algorithm checks for safe resource allocation?",
      "answer": "Banker's algorithm",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Banker's algorithm determines if requests can be safely granted. It's the primary deadlock avoidance method.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_006"
    },
    {
      "question": "What system state guarantees all processes can complete?",
      "answer": "Safe state",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Safe states have execution sequences allowing all processes to finish. Deadlock cannot occur in safe states.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_007"
    },
    {
      "question": "What approach eliminates a necessary deadlock condition?",
      "answer": "Deadlock prevention",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Deadlock prevention removes at least one of the four necessary conditions. It guarantees deadlock impossibility.",
      "id": "dead_dead_e_finals_008"
    },
    {
      "question": "What approach ensures safe resource allocation decisions?",
      "answer": "Deadlock avoidance",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Deadlock avoidance grants requests only if the system remains in a safe state. It requires future resource knowledge.",
