    {
      "question": "What is the older symmetric encryption standard that AES replaced in 2001?",
      "answer": "DES",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data Encryption Standard",
        "3DES",
        "Triple DES"
      ],
      "explanation": "DES (Data Encryption Standard) was the primary encryption standard from 1977 until AES replaced it due to its small key size."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the AES key size considered most secure for highly sensitive data?",
      "answer": "256-bit",
      "alternatives": [
        "AES-256",
        "256 bits"
      ],
      "explanation": "AES-256 uses a 256-bit key length and provides the highest security level among AES variants."
    },
    {
      "question": "What property of hash functions ensures that even a small change in input drastically changes the output?",
      "answer": "Avalanche effect",
      "alternatives": [
        "Avalanche property",
        "Diffusion"
      ],
      "explanation": "The avalanche effect ensures that changing even one bit of input produces a completely different hash output."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the popular cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit hash value?",
      "answer": "SHA-256",
      "alternatives": [
        "SHA256",
        "Secure Hash Algorithm 256"
      ],
      "explanation": "SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 family and produces a 64-character hexadecimal hash from any input."
    },
    {
      "question": "What cipher mode allows the same plaintext block to encrypt differently each time?",
      "answer": "CBC",
      "alternatives": [
        "Cipher Block Chaining",
        "CBC mode"
      ],
      "explanation": "CBC mode XORs each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block before encryption, preventing pattern repetition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the random value used in CBC mode to ensure the first block encrypts uniquely?",
      "answer": "Initialization Vector",
      "alternatives": [
        "IV",
        "Initial vector"
      ],
      "explanation": "An Initialization Vector is a random value used to ensure identical plaintexts encrypt to different ciphertexts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of attack tries all possible keys until the correct one is found?",
      "answer": "Brute force attack",
      "alternatives": [
        "Brute-force",
        "Exhaustive key search",
        "Key exhaustion attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "A brute force attack systematically tries every possible key combination until it successfully decrypts the data."

      "question": "What mathematical problem makes RSA difficult to break?",
      "answer": "Integer factorization",
      "alternatives": [
        "Prime factorization",
        "Factoring large numbers",
        "Factorization problem"
      ],
      "explanation": "RSA security relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers."

    {
      "question": "What protocol combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption for secure web communication?",
      "answer": "TLS",
      "alternatives": [
        "Transport Layer Security",
        "SSL",
        "Secure Sockets Layer"
      ],
      "explanation": "TLS uses asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for data transfer, balancing security and performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cryptographic technique that allows computation on encrypted data without decrypting it?",
      "answer": "Homomorphic encryption",
      "alternatives": [
        "Fully homomorphic encryption",
        "FHE"
      ],
      "explanation": "Homomorphic encryption enables processing encrypted data while maintaining privacy, producing encrypted results that decrypt correctly."
