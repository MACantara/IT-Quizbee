  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What measures project performance by integrating scope, schedule, and cost?",
      "answer": "Earned Value Management",
      "alternatives": ["EVM"],
      "explanation": "EVM uses planned value, earned value, and actual cost to provide objective performance metrics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What estimation uses statistical relationships between variables?",
      "answer": "Parametric Estimating",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Parametric Estimating uses algorithms or statistical relationships to calculate cost or duration based on parameters."
    },
    {
      "question": "What network diagram shows task dependencies and sequences?",
      "answer": "PERT Chart",
      "alternatives": ["Network Diagram"],
      "explanation": "PERT Charts display project tasks in a network showing dependencies and critical paths."
    },
    {
      "question": "What allows project activities to start before preceding activities finish?",
      "answer": "Fast Tracking",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Fast Tracking overlaps activities normally done in sequence to compress the schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "What adds resources to shorten project duration?",
      "answer": "Crashing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Crashing adds resources to critical path activities to reduce project duration, typically increasing cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "What planning technique uses three time estimates for uncertainty?",
      "answer": "Three-Point Estimating",
      "alternatives": ["PERT Estimating"],
      "explanation": "Three-Point Estimating uses optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates to account for uncertainty."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hierarchically decomposes work into manageable components?",
      "answer": "Work Breakdown Structure",
      "alternatives": ["WBS"],
      "explanation": "WBS breaks down the project into smaller, more manageable pieces organized hierarchically."
    },
    {
      "question": "What manages communication between project team and stakeholders?",
      "answer": "Communication Management",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Communication Management ensures timely and appropriate generation, collection, and distribution of project information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What measures difference between planned and actual values?",
      "answer": "Variance",
      "alternatives": ["Schedule Variance", "Cost Variance"],
      "explanation": "Variance indicates the deviation of actual performance from the baseline plan."
    },
    {
      "question": "What meeting reviews lessons learned at project end?",
      "answer": "Post-mortem",
      "alternatives": ["Retrospective", "Lessons Learned Session"],
      "explanation": "Post-mortems capture what went well, what didn't, and how to improve future projects."
