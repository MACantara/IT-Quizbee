    {
      "question": "What is the average of a set of numbers called?",
      "answer": "Mean",
      "alternatives": ["Arithmetic mean", "Average"],
      "explanation": "The mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the count."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you call the middle value in an ordered dataset?",
      "answer": "Median",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The median divides a sorted dataset into two equal halves."

      "question": "What is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset?",
      "answer": "Mode",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The mode represents the value that appears most often."

    {
      "question": "What measure indicates how spread out data values are?",
      "answer": "Standard deviation",
      "alternatives": ["Standard Deviation", "SD"],
      "explanation": "Standard deviation quantifies variation from the mean."

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between the highest and lowest values?",
      "answer": "Range",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Range measures the span of the dataset from minimum to maximum."

    {
      "question": "What graph uses bars to show frequency distributions?",
      "answer": "Histogram",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Histograms display continuous data frequencies using adjacent bars."

    {
      "question": "What correlation coefficient value indicates no linear relationship?",
      "answer": "0",
      "alternatives": ["Zero"],
      "explanation": "A correlation of zero means no linear association between variables."

    {
      "question": "What is the square of the standard deviation?",
      "answer": "Variance",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean."

      "question": "What values divide data into four equal parts?",
      "answer": "Quartiles",
      "alternatives": ["Quartile"],
      "explanation": "Quartiles split data into four quarters at Q1, Q2, and Q3."

    {
      "question": "What bell-shaped distribution is symmetric around the mean?",
      "answer": "Normal distribution",
      "alternatives": ["Normal", "Gaussian distribution"],
      "explanation": "The normal distribution is the most common probability distribution."
