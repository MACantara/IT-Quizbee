    {
      "question": "What does CPU stand for?",
      "answer": "Central Processing Unit",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, often called the 'brain' of the computer. It executes instructions from programs by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions in computer programs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the three main components of a CPU?",
      "answer": "Control Unit, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), and Registers",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The CPU consists of three main components: Control Unit (coordinates and controls operations, fetches and decodes instructions), ALU (performs arithmetic and logical operations), and Registers (small, fast storage locations for temporary data and instructions). These work together to execute program instructions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Control Unit in a CPU?",
      "answer": "To fetch, decode, and execute instructions, coordinating all CPU operations",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Control Unit (CU) is the CPU component that directs the operation of the processor. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them to determine what actions are required, and coordinates the execution by sending control signals to other CPU components and peripheral devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does ALU stand for and what is its function?",
      "answer": "Arithmetic Logic Unit",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is the part of the CPU that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, comparisons). It receives operands from registers and returns the results to registers or memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a CPU register?",
      "answer": "A small, fast storage location within the CPU for temporary data",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Registers are the smallest and fastest storage locations in the CPU, built directly into the processor. They temporarily hold data, addresses, and instructions being actively used. Common registers include accumulator, program counter, instruction register, memory address register, and general-purpose registers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is clock speed measured in?",
      "answer": "Hertz (Hz)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Clock speed is measured in Hertz (Hz), typically in GigaHertz (GHz) for modern processors. It represents the number of cycles per second the CPU can execute. For example, a 3.5 GHz processor executes 3.5 billion cycles per second. However, clock speed alone doesn't determine overall performanceâ€”architecture, cores, and cache also matter."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between single-core and multi-core processors?",
      "answer": "Single-core has one processing unit, multi-core has multiple processing units on a single chip",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A single-core processor has one processing unit that executes instructions sequentially. A multi-core processor has multiple independent processing units (cores) on a single chip, allowing it to execute multiple instructions simultaneously (parallel processing). Dual-core has 2 cores, quad-core has 4, etc. Multi-core improves performance for multitasking and parallel applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is CPU cache?",
      "answer": "Small, very fast memory located on or near the CPU to store frequently accessed data",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "CPU cache is a small, extremely fast memory located on or very close to the CPU chip. It stores copies of frequently accessed data and instructions from main memory (RAM), reducing the time needed to access them. Cache is organized in levels (L1, L2, L3), with L1 being smallest/fastest and closest to the core."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the Program Counter (PC) register do?",
      "answer": "Stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Program Counter (PC), also called Instruction Pointer, is a register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed. After fetching an instruction, the PC is automatically incremented to point to the next instruction, creating the sequential flow of program execution (unless a jump or branch instruction changes it)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between RISC and CISC architectures?",
      "answer": "RISC (Reduced) uses simple, few instructions; CISC (Complex) uses many complex instructions",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) uses a small set of simple, efficient instructions that execute in one clock cycle, relying on software to combine them for complex operations (ARM, MIPS). CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) uses many complex instructions that can execute multiple operations in one instruction but may take multiple clock cycles (x86, Intel/AMD). Modern processors often use hybrid approaches."
