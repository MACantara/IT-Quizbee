    {
      "question": "What does VLIW stand for?",
      "answer": "Very Long Instruction Word",
      "alternatives": ["VLIW"],
      "explanation": "VLIW packs multiple operations into a single long instruction word for parallel execution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a predicated instruction?",
      "answer": "Instruction executed based on condition",
      "alternatives": ["Conditional execution instruction"],
      "explanation": "Predicated instructions execute only if a specified condition is true, reducing branches."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is register windowing in SPARC?",
      "answer": "Overlapping register sets for procedures",
      "alternatives": ["Register windows", "Sliding register sets"],
      "explanation": "Register windowing provides each procedure with its own set of registers that partially overlap with callers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does EPIC stand for?",
      "answer": "Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing",
      "alternatives": ["EPIC architecture"],
      "explanation": "EPIC is Intel's architecture philosophy where the compiler explicitly specifies parallelism."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a delay slot in branch instructions?",
      "answer": "Instruction after branch always executed",
      "alternatives": ["Branch delay slot", "Delayed branch"],
      "explanation": "The delay slot is the instruction immediately following a branch that executes regardless of branch outcome."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is instruction fusion in modern processors?",
      "answer": "Combining multiple instructions into one operation",
      "alternatives": ["Macro-op fusion", "Instruction merging"],
      "explanation": "Instruction fusion combines simple instructions into complex operations for more efficient execution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a barrel shifter?",
      "answer": "Hardware that shifts by any amount in one cycle",
      "alternatives": ["Shifter unit"],
      "explanation": "A barrel shifter can shift or rotate data by any number of bits in a single clock cycle."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does SIMT stand for?",
      "answer": "Single Instruction Multiple Thread",
      "alternatives": ["SIMT architecture"],
      "explanation": "SIMT executes the same instruction across multiple threads simultaneously, used in GPUs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a compressed instruction set?",
      "answer": "Smaller instruction encoding for code density",
      "alternatives": ["Compact instruction set", "Thumb mode"],
      "explanation": "Compressed instructions use fewer bits than standard instructions to reduce code size."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is PC-relative addressing used for?",
      "answer": "Calculate address relative to program counter",
      "alternatives": ["Position-independent addressing"],
      "explanation": "PC-relative addressing computes addresses based on the current program counter, enabling position-independent code."
