    {
      "question": "What is the paradox of material conditional?",
      "answer": "Counterintuitive cases make formulas true",
      "alternatives": [
        "Conditional paradox"
      ],
      "explanation": "Issue: vacuous truth (false antecedent) seems wrong. 'If unicorns exist, 2+2=5' seems false but is true. Alternative: subjunctive conditional (modal logic). Resolution: depends on definition. Importance: highlights definition limits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is strengthening the antecedent?",
      "answer": "Making condition more restrictive",
      "alternatives": [
        "Adding conditions"
      ],
      "explanation": "Method: pq and (pr)q both true. Addition: r strengthens p. Implication: q still follows from stronger condition. Example: 'If rains, wet; if rains AND sunny, wet'. Application: analysis, refinement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is weakening the consequent?",
      "answer": "Making conclusion less restrictive",
      "alternatives": [
        "Loosening conclusion"
      ],
      "explanation": "Method: pq and p(qr) both true. Disjunction: r weakens q. Implication: weaker q always true. Example: 'If study, pass; if study, pass or get credit'. Application: generalization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is conditional proof?",
      "answer": "Assume antecedent, derive consequent",
      "alternatives": [
        "Proof technique"
      ],
      "explanation": "Method: to prove pq, assume p and show q. Advantage: simplifies complex conditionals. Application: deductive proofs. Principle: deduction theorem justifies. Importance: standard proof technique."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is proof by contrapositive?",
      "answer": "Prove qp to establish pq",
      "alternatives": [
        "Contrapositive proof"
      ],
      "explanation": "Method: pq equivalent qp. Advantage: sometimes easier to prove contrapositive. Example: 'If n even, n even' proved via contrapositive. Application: number theory, algorithms. Importance: alternative approach."

    {
      "question": "What is the exportation law?",
      "answer": "(pq)r  p(qr)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Exportation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: conjunction to nested conditional. Equivalence: both forms mean same. Proof: truth table verification. Application: formula manipulation. Importance: logical equivalence."

    {
      "question": "What is the importation law?",
      "answer": "p(qr)  (pq)r",
      "alternatives": [
        "Importation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: reverse of exportation. Equivalence: both forms mean same. Proof: truth table verification. Application: formula transformation. Importance: logical equivalence."

    {
      "question": "What is rule generalization?",
      "answer": "If rule holds for all, holds generally",
      "alternatives": [
        "Universal generalization"
      ],
      "explanation": "Principle: pq for all instances implies universal rule. Logic: quantifier interaction. Application: mathematical proofs. Scope: variable scoping matters. Importance: universal statements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is conditional independence?",
      "answer": "Variables independent given condition",
      "alternatives": [
        "Conditional separation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Concept: p and q independent given r. Related: probability, statistics. Distinction: different independence types. Connection: logical and probabilistic. Application: Bayesian analysis, AI."

    {
      "question": "What is the closed world assumption?",
      "answer": "What's not provable is false",
      "alternatives": [
        "CWA"
      ],
      "explanation": "Assumption: closed world. Consequence: unprovable statements false. Alternative: open world assumption. Applications: databases, logic programming. Limitations: not all domains. Importance: assumption awareness critical."
