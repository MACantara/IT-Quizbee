      "answer": "Biometric authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Biometrics",
        "Biometric security"
      ],

      "alternatives": [
        "2FA",
        "Two factor authentication",
        "Dual authentication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Two-factor authentication combines two different authentication factors, typically something you know and something you have."

      "alternatives": [
        "Personal Identification Number",
        "Pin code"
      ],
      "explanation": "PINs are short numeric passwords commonly used for ATMs, phones, and other secure access points."

      "alternatives": [
        "MFA",
        "Multi factor authentication",
        "Multiple factor authentication"
