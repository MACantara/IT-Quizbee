    {
      "question": "What is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system?",
      "answer": "Authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "User authentication",
        "Identity verification"
      ],
      "explanation": "Authentication is the process of confirming that someone or something is who or what they claim to be. This typically involves checking credentials like passwords, fingerprints, or security tokens against stored information. Authentication is the first step in access control, followed by authorization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most common type of authentication that uses a secret string known only to the user?",
      "answer": "Password",
      "alternatives": [
        "Password authentication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Passwords are the most widely used authentication method. Users create a secret string that only they know, which is verified during login. While convenient, passwords have vulnerabilities including weak choices, reuse, and susceptibility to various attacks, leading to the adoption of stronger authentication methods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication method uses physical characteristics unique to an individual?",
      "answer": "Biometric authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Biometrics"
      ],
      "explanation": "Biometric authentication uses unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, or voice patterns to verify identity. These characteristics are difficult to forge or steal, making biometrics more secure than passwords. However, they raise privacy concerns and can't be changed if compromised."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for requiring two different forms of identification to verify a user?",
      "answer": "Two-factor authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "2FA",
        "Multi-factor authentication",
        "MFA"
      ],
      "explanation": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires two different types of credentials to verify identity, typically combining something you know (password), something you have (phone/token), or something you are (biometric). This significantly improves security because compromising one factor isn't enough to gain access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of authentication uses a physical device that generates time-based codes?",
      "answer": "Hardware token",
      "alternatives": [
        "Security token",
        "Authentication token"
      ],
      "explanation": "Hardware tokens are physical devices that generate one-time passwords (OTP) or codes for authentication. They can be key fobs displaying changing numbers or USB devices. Hardware tokens are more secure than SMS-based 2FA because they're not vulnerable to SIM swapping or network attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication factor involves something the user possesses?",
      "answer": "Possession factor",
      "alternatives": [
        "Something you have"
      ],
      "explanation": "The possession factor ('something you have') includes physical objects like security tokens, smart cards, mobile phones, or key fobs. This is commonly used in multi-factor authentication combined with knowledge factors (passwords) to strengthen security by requiring both knowledge and physical possession."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the authentication method where users log in once and gain access to multiple systems?",
      "answer": "Single Sign-On",
      "alternatives": [
        "SSO"
      ],
      "explanation": "Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to authenticate once and access multiple applications or systems without re-entering credentials. This improves user experience and can enhance security by reducing password fatigue and allowing centralized access control. Examples include logging into multiple Google services with one account."
    },
    {
      "question": "What temporary, time-sensitive code is used for one authentication session?",
      "answer": "One-time password",
      "alternatives": [
        "OTP",
        "One-time code"
      ],
      "explanation": "One-time passwords (OTP) are temporary codes valid for a single login session or transaction. They're typically generated by authenticator apps or hardware tokens and expire quickly (often 30-60 seconds). OTPs prevent replay attacks since each code can only be used once."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication factor involves something the user knows?",
      "answer": "Knowledge factor",
      "alternatives": [
        "Something you know"
      ],
      "explanation": "The knowledge factor ('something you know') includes information only the user should know, such as passwords, PINs, security questions, or passphrases. This is the most common authentication factor but is vulnerable to guessing, phishing, and social engineering if not properly protected."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the process of granting or denying specific access rights after successful authentication?",
      "answer": "Authorization",
      "alternatives": [
        "Access control"
      ],
      "explanation": "Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. While authentication verifies identity, authorization specifies permissions and access levels. For example, after logging in (authentication), a user may be authorized to read files but not delete them. These are distinct but related security concepts."
