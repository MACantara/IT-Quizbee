    {
      "question": "What architecture scales payments?",
      "answer": "Distributed payment system",
      "alternatives": [
        "Scalable architecture"
      ],
      "explanation": "Distributed payment system handles high volume. Load balancing: spread across servers. Queuing: handle spikes. Redundancy: failover protection. Database: sharding, replication. Monitoring: detect issues early. Example: Stripe infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What calculates exact settlement?",
      "answer": "Settlement algorithm",
      "alternatives": [
        "Settlement reconciliation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Settlement algorithm reconciles transactions. Matching: authorizations to settled amounts. Fees: calculated, deducted. Disputes: adjustments applied. Reporting: detailed breakdown. Accuracy: critical for accounting. Automation: reduces manual work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What prevents payment fraud?",
      "answer": "Advanced fraud prevention",
      "alternatives": [
        "Machine learning fraud detection"
      ],
      "explanation": "Advanced fraud prevention uses ML, rule engines. Features: transaction history, geography, device, behavior. Scoring: risk assessment. Real-time: decisions instant. Training: continuously improved. False positives: minimize friction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What handles payment compliance?",
      "answer": "Compliance framework",
      "alternatives": [
        "Regulatory compliance"
      ],
      "explanation": "Compliance framework ensures regulatory adherence. PCI DSS: card security. AML: anti-money laundering checks. KYC: know your customer. Regional: GDPR, CCPA requirements. Audits: regular verification. Documentation: essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ensures payment reliability?",
      "answer": "Fault tolerance",
      "alternatives": [
        "Payment reliability"
      ],
      "explanation": "Fault tolerance maintains operation despite failures. Redundancy: multiple payment processors. Circuit breaker: failover on timeout. Retry logic: automatic recovery. Monitoring: detect issues. RPO/RTO: minimize data loss, downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "What secures API keys?",
      "answer": "Key management",
      "alternatives": [
        "Secret management"
      ],
      "explanation": "Key management handles API credentials. Rotation: periodic updates. Storage: never hardcoded, use environment. Access control: least privilege. Encryption: at rest, in transit. Monitoring: usage tracked. Vault: centralized storage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What optimizes payment data?",
      "answer": "Payment tokenization strategy",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data optimization"
      ],
      "explanation": "Tokenization strategy reduces PCI scope. First-party tokens: issued by processor. Network tokenization: card network replaces. Benefits: lower compliance, better UX. Implementation: processor-specific. Fallback: legacy support."
    },
    {
      "question": "What balances payment security and UX?",
      "answer": "Risk-based authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Dynamic authentication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Risk-based auth adapts to risk level. Low risk: no friction. High risk: additional verification (3DS). Evaluation: multiple factors. Machine learning: score transaction. Balance: security vs convenience. Outcome: better conversion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What handles payment reconciliation?",
      "answer": "Reconciliation engine",
      "alternatives": [
        "Transaction reconciliation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Reconciliation engine matches transactions. Sources: payment gateway, bank, merchant system. Discrepancies: identified, investigated. Automation: most reconciliation handled. Reporting: discrepancies escalated. Manual: edge cases reviewed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What provides payment transparency?",
      "answer": "Payment analytics",
      "alternatives": [
        "Transaction analytics"
      ],
      "explanation": "Payment analytics provides visibility. Metrics: volume, value, success rate, chargebacks. Trends: seasonality, growth. Funnel: identify drop-off. Drilling: detailed investigation. Dashboards: real-time data. Actions: optimization based on insights."
