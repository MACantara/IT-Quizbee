    {
      "question": "What type of switch uses specialized hardware to make forwarding decisions?",
      "answer": "Layer 3 switch",
      "alternatives": ["L3 switch", "multilayer switch"],
      "explanation": "Layer 3 switches perform routing functions at wire speed using hardware ASICs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What algorithm do switches use to prevent loops in redundant topologies?",
      "answer": "Spanning Tree Protocol",
      "alternatives": ["STP", "spanning tree"],
      "explanation": "STP prevents network loops by blocking redundant paths while maintaining backup routes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of switching reads only the destination address before forwarding?",
      "answer": "cut-through switching",
      "alternatives": ["cut through", "fast forward"],
      "explanation": "Cut-through switching forwards frames immediately after reading the destination address."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of switching reads the entire frame before forwarding?",
      "answer": "store-and-forward",
      "alternatives": ["store and forward", "buffered switching"],
      "explanation": "Store-and-forward reads the entire frame and checks for errors before forwarding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What allows multiple VLANs to traverse a single link?",
      "answer": "trunk port",
      "alternatives": ["trunking", "VLAN trunking"],
      "explanation": "Trunk ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs using tagging protocols like 802.1Q."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique do routers use to reduce routing table size?",
      "answer": "route summarization",
      "alternatives": ["route aggregation", "supernetting", "CIDR"],
      "explanation": "Route summarization combines multiple routes into a single routing table entry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of firewall inspects packet contents and tracks connections?",
      "answer": "stateful firewall",
      "alternatives": ["stateful inspection firewall", "dynamic packet filtering"],
      "explanation": "Stateful firewalls track connection states and inspect packet contents for security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What device combines router, switch, and wireless access point functions?",
      "answer": "integrated router",
      "alternatives": ["all-in-one router", "wireless router", "home router"],
      "explanation": "Integrated routers combine multiple networking functions in a single device."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol allows multiple access points to work together seamlessly?",
      "answer": "roaming protocol",
      "alternatives": ["wireless roaming", "802.11r", "fast roaming"],
      "explanation": "Roaming protocols enable seamless handoff between access points as devices move."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hardware component in switches makes wire-speed forwarding possible?",
      "answer": "ASIC",
      "alternatives": ["Application-Specific Integrated Circuit", "switching ASIC"],
      "explanation": "ASICs are specialized chips that perform switching operations at hardware speed."
