    {
      "question": "What is the fastest type of memory in the memory hierarchy?",
      "answer": "Registers",
      "alternatives": [
        "CPU Registers",
        "Processor Registers"
      ],
      "explanation": "Registers are the fastest memory type, located directly within the CPU. They provide immediate access (typically within 1 clock cycle) and are used to store data currently being processed by the ALU."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of memory is volatile and loses its data when power is turned off?",
      "answer": "RAM (Random Access Memory)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Random Access Memory",
        "Main Memory"
      ],
      "explanation": "RAM is volatile memory that requires constant power to maintain its contents. When the computer is turned off or loses power, all data in RAM is lost. This is why we need to save work to non-volatile storage like hard drives or SSDs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the small, fast memory located between the CPU and main memory?",
      "answer": "Cache",
      "alternatives": [
        "Cache Memory",
        "CPU Cache"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cache memory acts as a buffer between the fast CPU and slower main memory (RAM). It stores copies of frequently accessed data to reduce the average time to access memory, exploiting the principle of locality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for the time delay in accessing data from memory?",
      "answer": "Latency",
      "alternatives": [
        "Memory Latency",
        "Access Latency"
      ],
      "explanation": "Memory latency is the time delay between requesting data and receiving it. Different types of memory have vastly different latencies: registers (< 1ns), L1 cache (~ 1ns), RAM (~100ns), SSD (~100Î¼s), HDD (~10ms)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the largest but slowest level of the memory hierarchy?",
      "answer": "Secondary Storage",
      "alternatives": [
        "Hard Drive",
        "Storage",
        "Persistent Storage"
      ],
      "explanation": "Secondary storage (hard drives, SSDs) sits at the bottom of the memory hierarchy. While it has the largest capacity and is non-volatile (persists without power), it's also the slowest to access, taking milliseconds compared to nanoseconds for cache."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the intermediate memory technology between RAM and hard drives that uses flash memory?",
      "answer": "SSD (Solid State Drive)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Solid State Drive",
        "Flash Storage"
      ],
      "explanation": "SSDs use NAND flash memory to provide faster access than traditional hard drives while maintaining non-volatile storage. They offer a middle ground between the speed of RAM and the capacity/persistence of HDDs, with typical access times around 100 microseconds."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for temporarily storing copies of frequently accessed data to speed up access?",
      "answer": "Caching",
      "alternatives": [
        "Cache"
      ],
      "explanation": "Caching is the technique of storing copies of data in faster storage to reduce access time. It works based on the principle of locality: programs tend to access the same data repeatedly (temporal locality) and nearby data (spatial locality)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What cache level is closest to the CPU core?",
      "answer": "L1 Cache",
      "alternatives": [
        "Level 1 Cache",
        "Primary Cache"
      ],
      "explanation": "L1 cache is the smallest but fastest cache, located directly on each CPU core. Modern processors typically have separate L1 caches for instructions (L1-I) and data (L1-D), each ranging from 16-64KB with access times under 1 nanosecond."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for the amount of data that can be transferred per unit of time?",
      "answer": "Bandwidth",
      "alternatives": [
        "Memory Bandwidth",
        "Data Transfer Rate"
      ],
      "explanation": "Memory bandwidth measures how much data can be transferred between memory and the processor per second, typically measured in GB/s. High bandwidth is crucial for applications that process large amounts of data, like video processing or scientific computing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the memory management technique that uses disk space as an extension of RAM?",
      "answer": "Virtual Memory",
      "alternatives": [
        "Paging",
        "Virtual Memory System"
      ],
      "explanation": "Virtual memory allows the operating system to use disk storage as an extension of RAM, creating the illusion of more memory than physically available. Pages of memory not currently in use are swapped to disk, allowing larger programs to run on systems with limited RAM."
