    {
      "question": "What is predicate logic?",
      "answer": "Logic with predicates and quantifiers",
      "alternatives": [
        "First-order logic"
      ],
      "explanation": "Logic: extends propositional. Addition: quantifiers, predicates. Power: express properties. Example: P(x) 'x is prime'. Foundation: first-order logic. Importance: universal formal framework."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a predicate?",
      "answer": "Function to truth values",
      "alternatives": [
        "Propositional function"
      ],
      "explanation": "Predicate: P(x) maps x to T/F. Example: 'Even(2)' true, 'Even(3)' false. Arity: unary 1, binary 2, etc. Application: properties, relations. Importance: foundation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a constant?",
      "answer": "Fixed object in domain",
      "alternatives": [
        "Individual"
      ],
      "explanation": "Constant: a, b, c represent specific elements. Example: Socrates, 2, red. Domain: fixed element. Application: specific objects. Importance: reference."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a variable?",
      "answer": "Placeholder for domain elements",
      "alternatives": [
        "Quantifiable"
      ],
      "explanation": "Variable: x, y, z range over domain. Binding: quantifiers bind variables. Example: x P(x). Application: generalizations. Importance: abstraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a function symbol?",
      "answer": "Function in domain",
      "alternatives": [
        "Operation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Function: f(x) applies to domain elements. Example: successor, +, . Application: compound terms. Importance: structure. Arity: f(x) unary, f(x,y) binary."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a term?",
      "answer": "Expression denoting domain element",
      "alternatives": [
        "Object expression"
      ],
      "explanation": "Term: constant, variable, or f(t,...,t). Example: 2, x, 2+3. Application: denoting objects. Importance: structure. Syntax: formal expressions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ground term?",
      "answer": "Term with no variables",
      "alternatives": [
        "Closed term"
      ],
      "explanation": "Ground: fully evaluated. Example: 2+3 ground, 2+x not. Application: specific values. Importance: instantiation. Contrast: open term has variables."

      "question": "What is an atom?",
      "answer": "Predicate applied to terms",
      "alternatives": [
        "Atomic formula"
      ],
      "explanation": "Atom: P(t,...,t). Example: Prime(2), Greater(3,2). Application: facts. Importance: basic formula. Contrast: compound formula."

    {
      "question": "What is interpretation?",
      "answer": "Assignment of meaning to symbols",
      "alternatives": [
        "Model"
      ],
      "explanation": "Interpretation: domain + meaning assignment. Purpose: evaluate formulas. Example: Prime(2) under integers. Application: semantics. Importance: truth definition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a model?",
      "answer": "Interpretation making formula true",
      "alternatives": [
        "Satisfying assignment"
      ],
      "explanation": "Model: interpretation where formula true. Example: natural numbers model 'All primes odd' (false). Application: semantic verification. Importance: truth."
