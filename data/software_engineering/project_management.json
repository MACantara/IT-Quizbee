      "question": "What is project management?",
      "options": [
        "The application of knowledge, skills, and techniques to execute projects effectively",
        "Writing code",
        "Testing software",
        "Database design"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. It involves initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the project management triangle (triple constraint)?",
      "options": [
        "Scope, Time, and Cost - the three main constraints that must be balanced",
        "Design, Development, Testing",
        "Hardware, Software, Network",
        "Frontend, Backend, Database"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The project management triangle represents three main constraints: Scope (what is delivered), Time (schedule), and Cost (budget). Changing one affects the others. Some models add Quality as a fourth constraint."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?",
      "options": [
        "A hierarchical decomposition of project work into smaller, manageable components",
        "A list of broken items",
        "An organizational chart",
        "A budget spreadsheet"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A Work Breakdown Structure is a hierarchical decomposition of the total project scope into smaller, more manageable work packages. It helps organize and define the total scope, making planning and control easier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Gantt chart?",
      "options": [
        "A bar chart showing project tasks scheduled over time",

        "A flowchart",
        "An organizational chart"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, showing tasks, their durations, start and end dates, and dependencies. It provides a visual timeline of project activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the critical path in project management?",
      "options": [
        "The longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines minimum project duration",
        "The most expensive tasks",
        "The first tasks to complete",
        "The optional tasks"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The critical path is the longest sequence of dependent activities in a project network diagram. It determines the minimum time required to complete the project. Delays in critical path activities delay the entire project."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a project milestone?",
      "options": [
        "A significant point or event in the project timeline marking completion of a major phase",
        "A physical marker",
        "A budget item",
        "A team member"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A milestone is a significant point or event in a project that marks the completion of a major deliverable or phase. Milestones have zero duration and are used to track progress and measure achievement."

    {
      "question": "What is risk management in projects?",
      "options": [
        "Identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risks",
        "Taking unnecessary risks",
        "Avoiding all risks",
        "Gambling"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Risk management involves identifying potential risks, analyzing their probability and impact, and developing strategies to respond (avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept). It's essential for project success."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is scope creep?",
      "options": [
        "Uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in project scope",
        "Moving slowly",
        "Budget overruns",
        "Staff turnover"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Scope creep occurs when project scope expands beyond its original objectives without corresponding adjustments to time, cost, and resources. It results from uncontrolled changes and poor scope management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a project stakeholder?",
      "options": [
        "Any individual or group affected by or able to affect the project",
        "Only project managers",
        "Only developers",
        "Only customers"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A stakeholder is anyone who is affected by or can affect the project - including customers, sponsors, team members, managers, users, and others. Effective stakeholder management is crucial for project success."

      "question": "What is resource leveling?",
      "options": [
        "Adjusting project schedule to resolve resource conflicts and overallocations",
        "Making resources equal",
        "Deleting resources",
        "Hiring more staff"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Resource leveling is a technique used to resolve resource conflicts and overallocations by adjusting the project schedule. It may involve delaying tasks or splitting work to ensure resources aren't over-committed."
