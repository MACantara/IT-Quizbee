      "question": "What protocol secures web communications by encrypting data between browsers and servers?",
      "answer": "HTTPS",
      "alternatives": [
        "HTTP Secure",
        "SSL/TLS"
      ],
      "explanation": "HTTPS (HTTP Secure) encrypts web traffic using SSL/TLS protocols, protecting data from eavesdropping and tampering. The padlock icon in browsers indicates HTTPS is active. It's essential for protecting sensitive information like passwords and financial data. HTTPS has become standard for all websites, not just those handling sensitive data."

    {
      "question": "What security protocol encrypts data transmitted over wireless networks?",
      "answer": "WPA2",
      "alternatives": [
        "WPA3",
        "WiFi Protected Access"
      ],
      "explanation": "WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2) secures wireless networks using AES encryption. It replaced the vulnerable WEP protocol. WPA3, the latest version, offers enhanced security including protection against brute force attacks and forward secrecy. Using strong passwords and WPA2/WPA3 is essential for WiFi security."

    {
      "question": "What protocol creates an encrypted tunnel for secure remote access over public networks?",
      "answer": "VPN",
      "alternatives": [
        "Virtual Private Network"
      ],
      "explanation": "VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) create encrypted tunnels between devices and networks over the internet, protecting data from interception. They're used for secure remote access to corporate networks, privacy protection, and bypassing geographic restrictions. Common VPN protocols include OpenVPN, IPsec, and WireGuard."

    {
      "question": "What protocol secures email transmission between mail servers?",
      "answer": "TLS",
      "alternatives": [
        "Transport Layer Security",
        "STARTTLS"
      ],
      "explanation": "TLS (Transport Layer Security) secures various internet protocols including email (SMTP with STARTTLS). It provides encryption, authentication, and integrity for data in transit. TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are current standards, with older versions like SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 being deprecated due to vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol provides secure remote command-line access to servers?",
      "answer": "SSH",
      "alternatives": [
        "Secure Shell"
      ],
      "explanation": "SSH (Secure Shell) provides encrypted remote access to systems, replacing insecure Telnet. It supports secure file transfer (SCP, SFTP), port forwarding, and key-based authentication. SSH uses public key cryptography for authentication and symmetric encryption for data transfer. It's fundamental for system administration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What security layer was replaced by the more secure TLS protocol?",
      "answer": "SSL",
      "alternatives": [
        "Secure Sockets Layer"
      ],
      "explanation": "SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) was the predecessor to TLS. SSL 2.0 and 3.0 have known vulnerabilities and are now deprecated. While people still say 'SSL certificates' or 'SSL/TLS', modern systems actually use TLS. The term persists due to historical naming, but TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are the secure standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol secures file transfers by encrypting data during transmission?",
      "answer": "SFTP",
      "alternatives": [
        "SSH File Transfer Protocol",
        "Secure FTP"
      ],
      "explanation": "SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) provides secure file transfer over SSH, encrypting both commands and data. It's different from FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS). SFTP is preferred for secure file transfers because it uses a single port and integrates with SSH authentication. It replaces insecure FTP for sensitive data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol authenticates and encrypts VPN connections using certificates?",
      "answer": "IPsec",
      "alternatives": [
        "IP Security"
      ],
      "explanation": "IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) authenticates and encrypts IP packets, commonly used in VPNs for site-to-site and remote access connections. It operates at the network layer, providing security for all applications. IPsec can use AH (Authentication Header) for integrity or ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) for encryption and integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol ensures DNS responses are authentic and unmodified?",
      "answer": "DNSSEC",
      "alternatives": [
        "DNS Security Extensions"
      ],
      "explanation": "DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records, allowing verification that responses are authentic and haven't been tampered with. This prevents DNS poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks. DNSSEC uses public key cryptography to create a chain of trust from root DNS servers down to individual domains."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol family secures electronic mail end-to-end?",
      "answer": "PGP",
      "alternatives": [
        "Pretty Good Privacy",
        "GPG",
        "GnuPG"
      ],
      "explanation": "PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and its open-source implementation GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) provide end-to-end email encryption using public key cryptography. Senders encrypt with recipients' public keys; only recipients can decrypt with their private keys. PGP also provides digital signatures for authentication and integrity."
