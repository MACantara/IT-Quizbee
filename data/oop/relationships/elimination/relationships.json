    {
      "question": "Which relationship type describes a general connection between two classes where one class uses or interacts with another?",
      "options": [
        "Composition",
        "Association",
        "Aggregation",
        "Dependency"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Association is the general relationship type that describes any connection between classes where objects of one class are connected to objects of another. It represents a uses-a or knows-about relationship."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of relationship represents a whole-part connection where the part can exist independently of the whole?",
      "options": [
        "Composition",
        "Dependency",
        "Aggregation",
        "Inheritance"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Aggregation is a has-a relationship where the part can exist independently. For example, a Department has Employees, but employees can exist without the department."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which relationship indicates a strong ownership where the part cannot exist without the whole?",
      "options": [
        "Association",
        "Aggregation",
        "Composition",
        "Dependency"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Composition is a strong has-a relationship with exclusive ownership. The part's lifecycle depends on the whole. For example, a House has Rooms, and rooms cannot exist without the house."
    },
    {
      "question": "What relationship type describes when one class uses another class temporarily, often as a method parameter?",
      "options": [
        "Dependency",
        "Association",
        "Aggregation",
        "Composition"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Dependency is a uses-a relationship where one class depends on another temporarily. It's often shown when a class is used as a parameter, local variable, or return type."
    },
    {
      "question": "In UML diagrams, what does multiplicity indicate in a relationship?",
      "options": [
        "The strength of the relationship",
        "The number of instances that can participate",
        "The direction of navigation",
        "The type of association"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Multiplicity specifies how many instances of a class can be associated with instances of another class. Common notations include 1, *, 0..1, and 1..* to indicate the number of possible connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which symbol in UML represents an aggregation relationship?",
      "options": [
        "Solid diamond",
        "Hollow diamond",
        "Arrow",
        "Dashed line"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A hollow diamond on the whole side represents aggregation. The hollow shape indicates the weaker ownership compared to composition's filled diamond."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a bidirectional association?",
      "options": [
        "An association with two multiplicities",
        "An association where both classes know about each other",
        "An association with two navigation arrows",
        "An association between two classes"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A bidirectional association allows navigation in both directions, meaning both classes maintain references to each other. For example, a Student knows their Courses, and a Course knows its Students."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which relationship type is stronger than aggregation but represents exclusive ownership?",
      "options": [
        "Association",
        "Dependency",
        "Composition",
        "Inheritance"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Composition is stronger than aggregation because it represents exclusive ownership where the part cannot exist without the whole. When the whole is destroyed, all parts are also destroyed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does cardinality specify in object relationships?",
      "options": [
        "The direction of the relationship",
        "The number of objects involved in a relationship",
        "The type of relationship",
        "The strength of the relationship"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cardinality defines the number of instances that can participate in a relationship. It's expressed through multiplicity notations like one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many."
    },
    {
      "question": "In UML, what does a filled diamond symbol represent?",
      "options": [
        "Aggregation",
        "Association",
        "Composition",
        "Dependency"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A filled diamond represents composition, indicating strong ownership where the part cannot exist independently of the whole. It's placed on the whole side of the relationship."
