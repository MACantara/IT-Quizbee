    {
      "question": "What type of chart uses rectangular bars to compare values across categories?",
      "answer": "Bar chart",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bar graph"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bar charts display categorical data with rectangular bars representing values. Bars can be vertical (column chart) or horizontal. They're ideal for comparing quantities across discrete categories like sales by region or preferences by group. Bar length encodes value, making comparisons intuitive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What chart type shows data points as dots on two axes?",
      "answer": "Scatter plot",
      "alternatives": [
        "Scatterplot"
      ],
      "explanation": "Scatter plots display relationships between two numerical variables by plotting points on x and y axes. They reveal correlations, clusters, and outliers. Each point represents an observation with coordinates determined by variable values. Adding trend lines or colors for categories enhances insight."
    },
    {
      "question": "What visualization shows data distribution using quartiles and potential outliers?",
      "answer": "Box plot",
      "alternatives": [
        "Box-and-whisker plot"
      ],
      "explanation": "Box plots display data distribution through five-number summary: minimum, Q1 (25th percentile), median (Q2), Q3 (75th percentile), and maximum. The box spans Q1 to Q3 (interquartile range), with a line at the median. Whiskers extend to extremes within 1.5Ã—IQR; points beyond are outliers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What chart shows parts of a whole as slices of a circle?",
      "answer": "Pie chart",
      "alternatives": [
        "Pie graph"
      ],
      "explanation": "Pie charts display proportions of a whole using circular slices where each slice's angle represents its percentage. While popular, they're limited to showing composition of a single total and comparing slices is difficult. Bar charts are often clearer for multiple categories or precise comparisons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What visualization displays data values as colors in a matrix?",
      "answer": "Heatmap",
      "alternatives": [
        "Heat map"
      ],
      "explanation": "Heatmaps use color intensity to represent data values in a matrix format. They're excellent for revealing patterns in large datasets, showing correlations between variables, or visualizing data over two dimensions like time and categories. Color scales should be chosen carefully for accessibility and clarity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What chart connects data points with line segments to show trends?",
      "answer": "Line chart",
      "alternatives": [
        "Line graph"
      ],
      "explanation": "Line charts connect sequential data points with lines, ideal for showing trends over time or continuous variables. Multiple lines can compare different series. Line charts emphasize overall patterns and direction of change. They're most effective when data has a natural order."
    },
    {
      "question": "What visualization shows the distribution of continuous data using adjacent bars?",
      "answer": "Histogram",
      "alternatives": [
        "Frequency histogram"
      ],
      "explanation": "Histograms display continuous data distribution by grouping values into bins and showing frequency with bar heights. Unlike bar charts (categorical), histogram bars touch because they represent continuous ranges. Bin width affects appearance - too wide loses detail, too narrow looks noisy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What principle states that visualizations should maximize data-ink ratio?",
      "answer": "Data-ink ratio",
      "alternatives": [
        "Tufte's principle"
      ],
      "explanation": "Data-ink ratio, introduced by Edward Tufte, is the proportion of ink dedicated to displaying actual data versus decoration. High data-ink ratio removes chart junk (unnecessary decorations) and maximizes information. This principle encourages minimalist, clear visualizations focusing on data rather than embellishment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What color scheme uses sequential shades of one color?",
      "answer": "Sequential color scale",
      "alternatives": [
        "Gradient color scale"
      ],
      "explanation": "Sequential color scales use gradual changes in lightness/saturation of a single color to represent ordered data from low to high. They're ideal for showing magnitude or density. Examples include light blue to dark blue for elevation or temperature data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of visualization combines a box plot with actual data points?",
      "answer": "Violin plot",
      "alternatives": [
        "Violin chart"
      ],
      "explanation": "Violin plots combine box plots with kernel density plots, showing distribution shape on both sides of the box. They reveal multimodality and distribution details better than box plots alone. Width at each value indicates density, providing a richer view of data distribution."
