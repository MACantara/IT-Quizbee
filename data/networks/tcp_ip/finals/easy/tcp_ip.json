      "question": "What is TCP/IP?",
      "answer": "Internet protocol suite",
      "alternatives": [
        "Protocol stack"
      ],
      "explanation": "TCP/IP: fundamental protocols. Layers: multiple. Development: DARPA. Standard: de facto internet standard. Reliability: basis for internet. Coverage: physical to application. Importance: modern networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a protocol stack?",
      "answer": "Layered protocols working together",
      "alternatives": [
        "Protocol layers"
      ],
      "explanation": "Stack: hierarchical protocols. Function: each layer adds value. Communication: layers interact. Example: TCP/IP has 4-5 layers. Purpose: organization, separation of concerns. Importance: abstraction."

      "question": "What is IP (Internet Protocol)?",
      "answer": "Addresses and routes packets",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network layer protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "IP: fundamental protocol. Function: logical addressing, routing. Versions: IPv4, IPv6. Datagrams: basic unit. Header: contains addresses. Importance: foundation."

    {
      "question": "What is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)?",
      "answer": "Reliable connection-oriented protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Reliable transport"
      ],
      "explanation": "TCP: ensures delivery. Features: sequencing, error checking, flow control. Connection: three-way handshake. Stream: data flow. Importance: email, web, file transfer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is UDP (User Datagram Protocol)?",
      "answer": "Fast connectionless protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Unreliable transport"
      ],
      "explanation": "UDP: minimal overhead. Features: none (no sequencing). Speed: fast. Connectionless: no handshake. Usage: real-time, speed critical. Importance: streaming, gaming, DNS."

      "question": "What is ICMP?",
      "answer": "Internet Control Message Protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Diagnostics protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "ICMP: error reporting. Messages: ping, traceroute. Purpose: network diagnostics. Mechanism: ECHO request/reply. Importance: troubleshooting. Security: can be used for attacks."

      "question": "What is IGMP?",
      "answer": "Internet Group Management Protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Multicast protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "IGMP: manages multicast groups. Purpose: multicast reception. Versions: IGMPv1, v2, v3. Routers: track memberships. Importance: video distribution. Usage: streaming services."

    {
      "question": "What is multicast?",
      "answer": "One-to-many communication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Group communication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Multicast: single source, multiple destinations. Efficiency: bandwidth saving. Addresses: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255. Example: video streaming. vs Unicast: one-to-one."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is broadcast?",
      "answer": "One-to-all communication",
      "alternatives": [
        "All devices"
      ],
      "explanation": "Broadcast: all devices in network. Address: .255 (e.g., 192.168.1.255). Efficiency: flooding. Limitation: only local network. Example: DHCP discovery. Impact: traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is unicast?",
      "answer": "One-to-one communication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Point-to-point"
      ],
      "explanation": "Unicast: specific destination. Standard: typical communication. Efficiency: direct delivery. Scalability: works for all. Example: web browsing. Importance: most common."
