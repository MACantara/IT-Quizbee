    {
      "question": "What technique extends physical memory using disk space?",
      "answer": "Virtual memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Virtual memory allows processes to use more memory than physically available by storing less-used pages on disk. It provides memory abstraction.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_000"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a fixed-size block of physical memory?",
      "answer": "Frame",
      "alternatives": [
        "Page frame"
      ],
      "explanation": "Frames are fixed-size blocks of physical memory. Virtual memory pages map to these frames through page tables.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_001"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a fixed-size block of virtual memory?",
      "answer": "Page",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Pages are fixed-size units of virtual memory. They're mapped to physical frames and can be swapped to disk when needed.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_002"
    },
    {
      "question": "What exception occurs when accessing a page not in memory?",
      "answer": "Page fault",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Page faults trigger when referencing pages not in RAM. The OS handles them by loading the page from disk.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_003"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structure translates virtual to physical addresses?",
      "answer": "Page table",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Page tables map virtual page numbers to physical frame numbers. Each process has its own page table.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_004"
    },
    {
      "question": "What occurs when the system spends excessive time paging?",
      "answer": "Thrashing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Thrashing happens when constant page swapping leaves little time for execution. It severely degrades system performance.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_005"
    },
    {
      "question": "What memory scheme uses variable-sized logical units?",
      "answer": "Segmentation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Segmentation divides memory into logical units like code, data, and stack. Segments can vary in size.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_006"
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique loads pages only when accessed?",
      "answer": "Demand paging",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Demand paging defers page loading until access, triggering page faults. It reduces startup time and memory usage.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_007"
    },
    {
      "question": "What algorithm replaces the oldest page in memory?",
      "answer": "FIFO",
      "alternatives": [
        "First-In First-Out"
      ],
      "explanation": "FIFO replaces the page loaded longest ago. It's simple but doesn't consider page usage patterns.",
      "id": "mem_man_mem_man_e_finals_008"
    },
    {
      "question": "What algorithm replaces the least recently used page?",
      "answer": "LRU",
      "alternatives": [
        "Least Recently Used"
      ],
      "explanation": "LRU replaces pages unused for the longest time. It approximates optimal replacement but is expensive to implement.",
