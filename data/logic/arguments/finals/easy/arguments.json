      "question": "What is an argument?",
      "answer": "Premises plus conclusion",

        "Logical argument"
      ],
      "explanation": "Argument: set premises, one conclusion. Purpose: reasoning. Form: 'P1, P2, therefore Q'. Analysis: validity check. Importance: reasoning foundation. Example: syllogism."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a premise?",
      "answer": "Assumed statement",
      "alternatives": [
        "Assumption"
      ],
      "explanation": "Premise: given as true. Role: support conclusion. Multiple: usually several. Application: foundation. Importance: reasoning base. Example: 'All men mortal'."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a conclusion?",
      "answer": "Derived from premises",
      "alternatives": [
        "Result"
      ],
      "explanation": "Conclusion: what follows. Role: what we derive. Single: one per argument. Application: result. Importance: reasoning target. Example: 'Therefore Socrates mortal'."

      "question": "What is validity?",
      "answer": "If premises true, conclusion true",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical validity"
      ],
      "explanation": "Validity: necessary consequence. Property: deductively sound. Test: counterexample? Invalid. Example: valid syllogism. Importance: reasoning quality. Contrast: soundness differs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is soundness?",
      "answer": "Valid with true premises",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical soundness"
      ],
      "explanation": "Soundness: validity + truth. Property: conclusion true. Requirements: both conditions. Importance: reasoning quality. Contrast: validity doesn't ensure truth. Example: sound arguments trustworthy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an invalid argument?",
      "answer": "Premises true, conclusion false possible",
      "alternatives": [
        "Invalid"
      ],
      "explanation": "Invalid: counterexample exists. Property: doesn't guarantee conclusion. Example: 'Some birds fly, therefore all fly'. Application: fallacy detection. Importance: reasoning quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a deductive argument?",
      "answer": "Premises guarantee conclusion",
      "alternatives": [
        "Deductive"
      ],
      "explanation": "Argument: necessary consequence. Strength: certainty. Example: logical deduction. Application: mathematics. Importance: strongest reasoning. Contrast: inductive weaker."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an inductive argument?",
      "answer": "Premises support, don't guarantee conclusion",
      "alternatives": [
        "Inductive"
      ],
      "explanation": "Argument: probable consequence. Strength: varies. Example: observations. Application: science. Importance: reasoning type. Contrast: weaker than deductive. Note: different from mathematical induction."

    {
      "question": "What is a fallacy?",
      "answer": "Error in reasoning",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical error"
      ],
      "explanation": "Fallacy: invalid reasoning. Type: formal or informal. Purpose: identify errors. Detection: recognizing patterns. Example: ad hominem. Importance: critical thinking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a formal fallacy?",
      "answer": "Error in logical form",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical form"
      ],
      "explanation": "Fallacy: violates logical rules. Type: affirming consequent. Detection: structural analysis. Example: invalid argument form. Application: logic. Importance: formal errors."
