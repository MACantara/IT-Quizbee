        "Not"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The universal quantifier ∀ means 'for all' or 'for every'. ∀x P(x) means 'for all x, P(x) is true' or 'P(x) is true for every x in the domain'."

      "correct": 1,

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The negation of 'for all x, P(x)' is 'there exists an x such that not P(x)'. Symbolically: ¬∀x P(x) ≡ ∃x ¬P(x). If not all x satisfy P, then at least one x doesn't."

      "explanation": "The negation of 'there exists an x such that P(x)' is 'for all x, not P(x)'. Symbolically: ¬∃x P(x) ≡ ∀x ¬P(x). If there's no x satisfying P, then all x don't satisfy P."

    {
      "question": "Does the order of quantifiers matter? For example, is ∀x ∃y P(x,y) the same as ∃y ∀x P(x,y)?",

        "No, they mean different things",
        "Yes, they're always equivalent",
        "Only if P is symmetric",
        "Only in propositional logic"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The order of quantifiers matters! ∀x ∃y P(x,y) means 'for every x, there is some y' (y can depend on x). ∃y ∀x P(x,y) means 'there exists one y that works for all x' (y is fixed). These are different."

        "Only the first predicate",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The scope of a quantifier is the part of the formula to which the quantifier applies. It's usually indicated by parentheses: ∀x (P(x) → Q(x))."

        "If any x has property P, then that x also has property Q",
        "Some x have both P and Q"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "∀x (P(x) → Q(x)) means 'for all x, if P(x) then Q(x)'. This states that whenever P holds for an object, Q must also hold for that object."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vacuous truth in the context of universal quantifiers?",
      "options": [
        "A statement that's always false",
        "A statement with no variables",
        "A statement that contradicts itself",
        "A universally quantified statement that's true because the domain is empty or the antecedent is always false"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A vacuous truth occurs when ∀x (P(x) → Q(x)) is true because P(x) is false for all x in the domain, making the implication trivially true regardless of Q(x)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you use the same variable for multiple quantifiers in one formula?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, but each occurrence defines a separate binding",

        "Only with universal quantifiers",
        "Only with existential quantifiers"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Yes, you can reuse variable names, but each quantifier creates its own binding. In ∀x P(x) ∧ ∃x Q(x), the two x's are independent and refer to different potential values."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "De Morgan's laws for quantifiers state that negating a universal quantifier gives an existential quantifier with negated predicate, and vice versa: ¬∀x P(x) ≡ ∃x ¬P(x) and ¬∃x P(x) ≡ ∀x ¬P(x)."
