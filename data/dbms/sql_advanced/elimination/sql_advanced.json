    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of a JOIN in SQL?",
      "options": [
        "To combine columns from one or more tables based on related columns",
        "To merge duplicate rows into a single row",
        "To create a backup of the table",
        "To sort data in ascending order"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. For example, joining a Customers table with an Orders table using customer_id allows you to retrieve customer information along with their orders."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of JOIN returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values where there's no match?",
      "options": [
        "INNER JOIN",
        "LEFT JOIN",
        "RIGHT JOIN",
        "FULL OUTER JOIN"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "FULL OUTER JOIN (or FULL JOIN) returns all rows from both tables. When there's a match, it combines the rows. When there's no match, it includes the row with NULL values for columns from the other table. This combines the effects of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a subquery in SQL?",
      "options": [
        "A query that runs after the main query completes",
        "A query nested inside another SQL query",
        "A query that only retrieves a subset of columns",
        "A query that updates multiple tables simultaneously"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A subquery (or inner query/nested query) is a query embedded within another SQL statement. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements, or inside WHERE, FROM, or HAVING clauses. Example: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a correlated subquery?",
      "options": [
        "A subquery that is executed once for each row of the outer query",
        "A subquery that uses the UNION operator",
        "A subquery that returns multiple columns",
        "A subquery that is independent of the outer query"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query and is executed once for each row processed by the outer query. Example: SELECT e1.name FROM Employees e1 WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees e2 WHERE e2.department = e1.department). The inner query references e1.department from the outer query."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a VIEW in SQL?",
      "options": [
        "A physical table that stores data permanently",
        "A virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query",
        "A backup copy of a table",
        "A temporary table created for a single transaction"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A VIEW is a virtual table that doesn't store data itself but displays data from one or more underlying tables based on a SELECT query. Views can simplify complex queries, provide data security by restricting access to specific columns/rows, and present data in a specific format. Changes to base tables are reflected in views."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a stored procedure?",
      "options": [
        "A saved SQL query that can be reused",
        "A precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database",
        "A backup of database data",
        "A temporary table that stores intermediate results"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database under a name. It can accept parameters, contain control-flow logic (IF, LOOP), and be called repeatedly. Benefits include improved performance (precompiled), code reusability, better security, and reduced network traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a trigger in SQL?",
      "options": [
        "A command that starts a transaction",
        "A stored procedure that automatically executes in response to specific events",
        "A constraint that validates data before insertion",
        "A function that calculates aggregate values"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes when a specific event occurs on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. Triggers can be set to fire BEFORE or AFTER the event. They're commonly used for enforcing business rules, maintaining audit trails, and ensuring data integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the HAVING clause do in SQL?",
      "options": [
        "Filters rows before grouping occurs",
        "Filters groups after GROUP BY is applied",
        "Sorts the results in descending order",
        "Joins multiple tables together"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The HAVING clause filters groups created by GROUP BY, while WHERE filters individual rows before grouping. HAVING is used with aggregate functions. Example: SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM Employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000 filters departments where average salary exceeds 50000."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Common Table Expression (CTE)?",
      "options": [
        "A permanent table stored in the database",
        "A temporary named result set defined within a query using WITH clause",
        "A type of index for faster query performance",
        "A constraint that ensures data uniqueness"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary named result set defined using the WITH clause that exists only for the duration of a query. CTEs improve readability, can be recursive, and are useful for breaking down complex queries. Example: WITH DeptAvg AS (SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) as avg_sal FROM Employees GROUP BY dept_id) SELECT * FROM DeptAvg WHERE avg_sal > 50000."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?",
      "options": [
        "UNION removes duplicates; UNION ALL keeps all rows including duplicates",
        "UNION sorts results; UNION ALL doesn't sort",
        "UNION works with two tables; UNION ALL works with multiple tables",
        "UNION is faster; UNION ALL is slower"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "UNION combines the results of two or more SELECT queries and removes duplicate rows, while UNION ALL combines all rows including duplicates. UNION ALL is faster because it doesn't perform duplicate elimination. Both require the same number of columns with compatible data types in all SELECT statements."
