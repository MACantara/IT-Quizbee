    {
      "question": "What is packet switching?",
      "answer": "Data sent as labeled packets",
      "alternatives": [
        "Packet transmission"
      ],
      "explanation": "Switching: break data into packets. Routing: each finds own path. Reassemble: destination reconstructs. Advantage: efficient, resilient. vs Circuit: connection-based. Modern: all networks use packets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is circuit switching?",
      "answer": "Dedicated path for communication",
      "alternatives": [
        "Connection-based"
      ],
      "explanation": "Switching: establish path first. Dedicated: exclusive connection. Example: telephone network. Disadvantage: inefficient, not flexible. vs Packet: packets find own routes. Modern: less common now."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is routing?",
      "answer": "Directing packets to destination",
      "alternatives": [
        "Path selection"
      ],
      "explanation": "Routing: find path from source to destination. Routers: devices making decisions. Algorithms: various methods. Dynamic: adapt to network changes. Static: fixed routes. Importance: packet delivery."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a router?",
      "answer": "Device connecting networks",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network connector"
      ],
      "explanation": "Router: connects LANs to WAN. Function: forward packets between networks. Address: IP level. Decision: routing table use. Example: home WiFi router. Importance: network interconnection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a switch?",
      "answer": "Device connecting devices in network",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network switch"
      ],
      "explanation": "Switch: connects computers in LAN. Frame level: operates at layer 2. Function: forward frames by MAC address. Speed: fast, local. vs Router: for network-level routing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is MAC address?",
      "answer": "Physical network device address",
      "alternatives": [
        "Hardware address"
      ],
      "explanation": "MAC: Media Access Control. Format: 48-bit (48 hex digits). Scope: local network only. vs IP: global scope. Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E. Importance: layer 2 communication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a firewall?",
      "answer": "Security barrier for network",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network security"
      ],
      "explanation": "Firewall: blocks unwanted traffic. Rules: allow/deny based on policy. Types: hardware, software. Purpose: protect network. Layer: can operate at multiple. Importance: essential security."

    {
      "question": "What is encryption?",
      "answer": "Scrambling data for security",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data protection"
      ],
      "explanation": "Encryption: readable to unreadable. Key: needed to decrypt. Purpose: confidentiality. Types: symmetric, asymmetric. Usage: HTTPS, VPN. Importance: data security critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a VPN?",
      "answer": "Virtual Private Network",
      "alternatives": [
        "Private network"
      ],
      "explanation": "VPN: encrypted tunnel through public network. Purpose: privacy, security. Remote: access private network. Encryption: traffic scrambled. Example: accessing office from home. Benefit: security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is DNS?",
      "answer": "Domain Name System",
      "alternatives": [
        "Name resolution"
      ],
      "explanation": "DNS: translates domain to IP. Example: google.com to 142.251.32.36. Purpose: human-readable names. Servers: distributed worldwide. Lookup: hierarchical process. Importance: web fundamental."
