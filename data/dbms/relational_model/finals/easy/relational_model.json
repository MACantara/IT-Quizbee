    {
      "question": "What is a table called in the relational model?",
      "answer": "Relation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "In formal relational model terminology, a table is called a relation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a row in a relation called?",
      "answer": "Tuple",
      "alternatives": ["Record"],
      "explanation": "A row in a relation is formally called a tuple, representing one complete record."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a column in a relation called?",
      "answer": "Attribute",
      "alternatives": ["Field"],
      "explanation": "A column is called an attribute, representing a specific property or characteristic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What term describes the number of attributes in a relation?",
      "answer": "Degree",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The degree indicates how many columns or attributes the relation contains."
    },
    {
      "question": "What term describes the number of tuples in a relation?",
      "answer": "Cardinality",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Cardinality specifies how many rows or tuples are present in the relation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of key uniquely identifies each tuple in a relation?",
      "answer": "Primary Key",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The primary key ensures each row can be uniquely identified and accessed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of key references the primary key of another relation?",
      "answer": "Foreign Key",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A foreign key establishes relationships between tables by referencing another table's primary key."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the set of all possible values an attribute can take?",
      "answer": "Domain",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The domain defines the valid range of values that an attribute can contain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What property ensures no two tuples in a relation are identical?",
      "answer": "Uniqueness",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Uniqueness guarantees that each tuple in a relation is distinct from all others."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do we call a key composed of multiple attributes?",
      "answer": "Composite Key",
      "alternatives": ["Compound Key"],
      "explanation": "A composite key uses two or more attributes together to uniquely identify tuples."
