      "question": "What is vacuous truth with quantifiers?",
      "answer": "Universal true over empty domain",
      "alternatives": [
        "Empty domain"
      ],
      "explanation": "Principle: x P(x) true if domain empty. Rationale: no counterexamples. Example: 'All unicorns white' true if no unicorns. Controversy: counterintuitive. Importance: formal semantics. Application: logic programs."

      "question": "What is quantifier scope ambiguity?",
      "answer": "Multiple interpretations from ambiguous scope",
      "alternatives": [
        "Scope ambiguity"
      ],
      "explanation": "Problem: x y P(x,y) vs y x P(x,y) different meaning. First: different y for each x. Second: same y for all x. Example: 'Everyone loves someone' ambiguous. Importance: disambiguation critical."

      "question": "What is variable capture?",
      "answer": "Substituting into scope renames variable",
      "alternatives": [
        "Capture avoidance"
      ],
      "explanation": "Problem: binding variable accidentally. Example: substituting y for x in x P(x) into y P(y) renames. Solution: fresh variables. Importance: formal semantics. Prevention: careful substitution."

      "question": "What is prenex normal form?",
      "answer": "All quantifiers at beginning",
      "alternatives": [
        "PNF"
      ],
      "explanation": "Form: Q1x1 Q2x2... F where Q quantifiers, F quantifier-free. Conversion: moving quantifiers out. Purpose: standardization. Application: proof procedures. Importance: normal form."

      "answer": "Removing existential quantifiers",
      "alternatives": [
        "Skolem functions"

      "explanation": "Process: y replaced by function f(x). Purpose: first-order logic to universal. Justification: Skolem theorem. Application: automated reasoning. Importance: proof techniques."

      "question": "What is a Skolem function?",
      "answer": "Function replacing existential quantifier",
      "alternatives": [
        "Witnessing function"
      ],
      "explanation": "Function: f(x,...,x) witnesses existential. Purpose: construct witness. Example: x y (y > x) becomes x (f(x) > x). Application: Skolemization. Importance: witness provision."

        "Universal elimination"
      ],
      "explanation": "Rule: x P(x) implies P(a) for any a. Logic: deduction rule. Soundness: valid inference. Example: 'All mortals die' implies 'Socrates dies'. Application: reasoning. Importance: fundamental rule."

        "Existential introduction"

      "explanation": "Rule: P(a) implies x P(x) for any a. Logic: deduction rule. Soundness: valid inference. Example: 'Socrates exists' implies 'Someone exists'. Application: reasoning. Importance: fundamental rule."

      "answer": "Semantic equivalence of quantified formulas",
      "alternatives": [
        "Quantifier equivalence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: x P(x)  y P(y) (renaming). Bound variables: names irrelevant. Logic: alpha-equivalence. Application: formula simplification. Importance: understanding quantifiers."

      "answer": "Different sorts for different domains",
      "alternatives": [
        "Sorted logic"
      ],
      "explanation": "Logic: variables have types. Domains: separate per type. Example: x:Person P(x). Advantage: expresses constraints. Application: specification. Importance: expressivity."
