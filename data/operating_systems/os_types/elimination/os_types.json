    {
      "question": "What is a batch operating system?",
      "options": [
        "An OS that processes jobs in batches without user interaction",
        "An OS that handles one user at a time",
        "A real-time OS",
        "A mobile OS"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A batch operating system collects similar jobs into batches and processes them without user interaction. Jobs are queued, executed sequentially, and users receive results later. Examples: early mainframe systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a time-sharing operating system?",
      "options": [
        "Multiple users share CPU time through rapid context switching",
        "One user uses the system at a time",
        "Real-time processing only",
        "Batch processing only"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Time-sharing (multitasking) OS allows multiple users to share computer resources simultaneously by rapidly switching the CPU between users. Each user gets a time slice, creating the illusion of dedicated access. Example: UNIX, Linux."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a real-time operating system (RTOS)?",
      "options": [
        "An OS that guarantees processing within strict time constraints",
        "An OS that runs quickly",
        "A batch processing system",
        "A desktop OS"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "An RTOS is designed to process data and events within strict time deadlines. Used in embedded systems, industrial control, medical devices, and aerospace where timing is critical. Types: hard real-time and soft real-time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a distributed operating system?",
      "options": [
        "An OS that manages multiple independent computers as a single system",
        "An OS installed on one computer",
        "A mobile OS",
        "A batch system"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A distributed OS manages a collection of independent computers and presents them to users as a single coherent system. Resources and processing are distributed across machines. Examples: Amoeba, Plan 9."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network operating system (NOS)?",
      "options": [
        "An OS that provides network services and manages networked resources",
        "An OS without networking",
        "A standalone OS",
        "A mobile OS"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A Network Operating System provides network services like file sharing, printer access, and user management across a network. Each computer runs its own OS but with network capabilities. Examples: Windows Server, Novell NetWare."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a mobile operating system?",
      "options": [
        "An OS designed for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets",
        "An OS for servers",
        "A mainframe OS",
        "A desktop OS"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Mobile OS are designed for smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices, optimized for touch interfaces, power efficiency, and wireless connectivity. Examples: Android, iOS, HarmonyOS."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an embedded operating system?",
      "options": [
        "An OS designed for specialized devices with specific functions",
        "A general-purpose OS",
        "A server OS",
        "A desktop OS"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Embedded OS are designed for specialized devices with dedicated functions, such as routers, IoT devices, automotive systems, and appliances. They are optimized for specific hardware and tasks. Examples: VxWorks, ThreadX, embedded Linux."
    },
    {
      "question": "What characterizes a multiprocessor operating system?",
      "options": [
        "Manages systems with multiple CPUs or cores working together",
        "Supports only one processor",
        "Runs on mobile devices",
        "Batch processing only"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Multiprocessor OS manage systems with multiple processors or cores, coordinating parallel execution and load balancing. Can be symmetric (SMP) where all processors are equal, or asymmetric. Modern OSes like Windows and Linux support multiprocessing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a single-user operating system?",
      "options": [
        "An OS designed for one user at a time",
        "An OS for multiple simultaneous users",
        "A server OS",
        "A distributed OS"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Single-user OS are designed to serve one user at a time, though they may run multiple programs concurrently (multitasking). Examples: MS-DOS (single-user, single-tasking), early Windows versions, consumer desktop OSes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a multi-user operating system?",
      "options": [
        "An OS that allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously",
        "An OS for one user only",
        "A mobile OS",
        "A batch system"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Multi-user OS allow multiple users to access the system concurrently, with each user having their own session, files, and permissions. Provides isolation and resource sharing. Examples: UNIX, Linux, Windows Server."
