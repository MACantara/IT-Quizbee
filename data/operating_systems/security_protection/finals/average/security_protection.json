      "question": "What security model uses subject-object-action triples?",
      "answer": "Access control triple",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Access control triples specify who can perform what actions on which objects. They formalize permissions.",

      "question": "What hierarchical levels enforce military security?",
      "answer": "Security clearances",
      "alternatives": [
        "Classification levels"
      ],
      "explanation": "Security clearances like Top Secret and Confidential control information access. They implement mandatory access control.",

      "question": "What attack exploits implementation errors to execute code?",
      "answer": "Buffer overflow",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Buffer overflows write beyond allocated memory. They can hijack control flow.",
