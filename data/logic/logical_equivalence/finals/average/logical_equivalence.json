      "answer": "p  p",
      "alternatives": [
        "Negation elimination"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: negate twice returns to original. Equivalence: both formulas same. Proof: truth table shows. Application: remove double negatives. Importance: simplification. Restriction: intuitionistic logic differs."

      "answer": "p(pq)  p",
      "alternatives": [
        "Absorption"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: p absorbs (pq). Equivalence: both formulas same. Proof: truth table shows. Application: eliminate redundant terms. Importance: simplification. Dual: p(pq)  p."

      "answer": "pp  T and pp  F",
      "alternatives": [
        "Contradiction and tautology"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: p or not p always true (excluded middle). p and not p always false (non-contradiction). Proof: truth table shows. Application: reasoning base. Importance: fundamental laws."

      "answer": "p  p (double negation)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Double negation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: same as double negation law. Name: involution emphasizes self-inverse. Equivalence: negation involution. Proof: truth table shows. Application: simplification. Importance: basic property."

      "question": "What is the conditional equivalence?",
      "answer": "pq  pq",
      "alternatives": [
        "Implication equivalence"

      "explanation": "Law: implication equals negated antecedent OR consequent. Equivalence: both formulas same. Proof: truth table shows. Application: eliminate conditionals. Importance: transformation rule."

      "answer": "pp  T",
      "alternatives": [
        "Tautology"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: p or not p always true. Foundation: classical logic. Equivalence: true always. Proof: truth table shows. Application: proof by cases. Controversy: intuitionistic logic disagrees."

        "Contradiction"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: p and not p always false. Foundation: logical consistency. Equivalence: false always. Proof: truth table shows. Application: contradiction detection. Importance: essential principle."

      "question": "What is substitution principle?",
      "answer": "Replace equivalent with equivalent preserves equivalence",
      "alternatives": [
        "Substitution"
      ],
      "explanation": "Principle: if pq, substitute p with q anywhere. Context: in any formula. Result: truth value unchanged. Proof: from equivalence definition. Application: formula transformation. Importance: enables simplification."
