# IT-Quizbee MySQL Setup Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure MySQL Connection

Edit or create `.env` file in the project root:

```env
MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL=mysql://username:password@host:port/database
```

### 3. Initialize Database

Create tables:

```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

Output:
```
======================================================================
IT-QUIZBEE: Database Initialization
======================================================================

âœ… Database initialized successfully!

Created tables:
  â€¢ quiz_sessions - Stores active quiz sessions
  â€¢ quiz_attempts - Stores quiz submission results

Database configuration:
  â€¢ Database URI: [your_database_uri_here]
  â€¢ Track Modifications: False
  â€¢ Pool Pre-ping: Enabled (connection verification)
  â€¢ Pool Recycle: 3600 seconds

======================================================================
âœ¨ Database is ready for use!
```

### 4. Run Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Application starts on `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

All tests should pass with the new database backend.

## Key Changes

### Session Storage
- **Before**: Flask-Session (file-based, 4KB limit)
- **After**: MySQL database (unlimited size)

### Session Flow
1. User starts quiz â†’ Creates `QuizSession` record in database
2. Session ID stored in HTTP-only cookie
3. User submits quiz â†’ Retrieves session from database
4. Results stored in `QuizAttempt` table
5. Session marked completed and cookie cleared

### Tables Created

**quiz_sessions** - Active quiz sessions
```
id (UUID)              - Session identifier
session_type           - 'elimination' or 'finals'

created_at            - Session creation time
expires_at            - Session expiration time (2 hours)
completed             - Whether quiz was submitted
```

**quiz_attempts** - Quiz submission results
```
id (UUID)              - Attempt identifier
session_id (FK)        - References quiz_sessions
quiz_mode              - 'elimination', 'finals', 'review'

difficulty             - Difficulty level (optional)
total_questions        - Total questions in quiz
correct_answers        - Number of correct answers
score_percentage       - Score as percentage
answers_json           - Detailed answer data (JSON)
created_at             - Attempt creation time
completed_at           - Attempt completion time
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test connection
python -c "from app import app; print(app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'])"
```

### View SQL Queries (Debug Mode)
```python
# In app.py
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_ECHO'] = True
```

### Check Database Tables
```bash
mysql -u root -p
USE railway;
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE quiz_sessions;
DESCRIBE quiz_attempts;
```

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to verify setup: `pytest tests/ -v`
2. Explore analytics endpoints
3. Monitor database performance
4. Set up automated backups
5. Implement additional analytics dashboards
