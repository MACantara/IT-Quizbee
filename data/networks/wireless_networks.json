    {
      "question": "What does WiFi stand for and what standard does it follow?",
      "options": [
        "Wireless Fidelity, based on IEEE 802.3 standards",
        "Wireless Fidelity, based on IEEE 802.11 standards",
        "Wide Frequency Interface, based on IEEE 802.15 standards",
        "Wireless File Transfer, based on IEEE 802.16 standards"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) is based on IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless local area networking. Different versions include 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax (WiFi 6), each offering different speeds, frequencies, and capabilities. WiFi enables wireless connectivity for computers, smartphones, and IoT devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which frequency bands are commonly used for WiFi?",
      "options": [
        "900 MHz and 1800 MHz",
        "2.4 GHz and 5 GHz",
        "3 GHz and 7 GHz",
        "1 GHz and 10 GHz"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "WiFi commonly uses 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands (WiFi 6E also uses 6 GHz). 2.4 GHz offers better range and penetration but more interference and lower speeds. 5 GHz provides faster speeds and less congestion but shorter range. Dual-band routers support both frequencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most secure wireless encryption standard currently recommended?",
      "options": [
        "WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)",
        "WPA (WiFi Protected Access)",
        "WPA2 or WPA3",
        "Open network with MAC filtering"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "WPA3 is the latest and most secure WiFi encryption standard, offering improved security over WPA2. WPA2 is still widely used and secure. WEP is outdated and easily cracked. WPA introduced improvements over WEP. WPA3 provides stronger encryption, protection against brute-force attacks, and enhanced public WiFi security."

    {
      "question": "What is SSID in wireless networking?",
      "options": [
        "Secure System Identification",
        "Service Set Identifier - the name of a wireless network",
        "Standard Security ID",
        "System Signal Integrity Data"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of a wireless network that appears when devices scan for available WiFi networks. It can be up to 32 characters long. Network administrators can hide SSIDs to reduce visibility, but this doesn't provide strong security. Clients must know the exact SSID to connect to hidden networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between infrastructure mode and ad-hoc mode in wireless networks?",
      "options": [
        "Infrastructure mode is faster than ad-hoc mode",
        "Infrastructure mode uses an access point; ad-hoc mode allows direct device-to-device communication",
        "Ad-hoc mode requires more equipment",
        "Infrastructure mode is wireless; ad-hoc mode is wired"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Infrastructure mode uses an access point (AP) as a central hub connecting wireless devices to a wired network. Ad-hoc mode (peer-to-peer) allows devices to communicate directly without an AP, useful for temporary connections or file sharing. Infrastructure mode is more common and offers better range and management."

    {
      "question": "What causes wireless network interference?",
      "options": [
        "Only physical obstacles like walls",
        "Other WiFi networks, microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, and physical obstacles",
        "Only distance from the router",
        "Internet service provider limitations"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Wireless interference comes from multiple sources: overlapping WiFi networks on the same channel, microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, baby monitors, and physical obstacles (walls, metal, water). The 2.4 GHz band is more congested. Using 5 GHz, changing channels, or repositioning equipment can reduce interference."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a wireless site survey used for?",
      "options": [
        "To count the number of wireless devices",
        "To analyze the wireless environment and determine optimal AP placement, channel selection, and coverage",
        "To measure internet speed only",
        "To check router firmware versions"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A wireless site survey analyzes the wireless environment to determine optimal access point placement, channel selection, power settings, and coverage areas. It identifies interference sources, dead zones, and signal strength. Site surveys ensure adequate coverage, minimize interference, and optimize performance for enterprise deployments."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of WiFi channels?",
      "options": [
        "To increase internet speed",
        "To divide the frequency band into separate communication pathways and reduce interference",
        "To encrypt wireless traffic",
        "To extend WiFi range"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "WiFi channels divide frequency bands into separate communication pathways. 2.4 GHz has 14 channels (1-11 in US), with only 1, 6, and 11 being non-overlapping. 5 GHz has more non-overlapping channels. Using different channels for nearby APs reduces interference and improves performance in dense environments."

    {
      "question": "What is a WiFi mesh network?",
      "options": [
        "A network with a single access point",
        "A system of multiple interconnected access points providing seamless roaming and extended coverage",
        "A type of wired network",
        "A network that only works outdoors"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A WiFi mesh network uses multiple interconnected access points (nodes) that work together to provide seamless coverage over large areas. Devices automatically connect to the strongest signal as they move. Mesh networks eliminate dead zones, offer self-healing capabilities, and are ideal for large homes or offices."

    {
      "question": "What is Bluetooth and how does it differ from WiFi?",
      "options": [
        "Bluetooth is the same as WiFi",
        "Bluetooth is for short-range, low-power device connections; WiFi is for longer-range, higher-speed network connectivity",
        "Bluetooth is faster than WiFi",
        "Bluetooth requires access points"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15) is designed for short-range (typically 10-100 meters), low-power, point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between devices (headphones, keyboards, sensors). WiFi (IEEE 802.11) provides longer-range, higher-speed network connectivity. Bluetooth uses less power; WiFi offers higher throughput. Both use 2.4 GHz but serve different purposes."
