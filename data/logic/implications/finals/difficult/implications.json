    {
      "question": "In the statement 'If p then q', what is p called?",
      "answer": "Hypothesis or antecedent",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "In the implication p → q, p is called the hypothesis (or antecedent or premise), and q is called the conclusion (or consequent)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the implication p → q false?",
      "answer": "Only when p is true and q is false",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The implication p → q is false only when the hypothesis p is true but the conclusion q is false. In all other cases, it is true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the converse of the implication p → q?",
      "answer": "q → p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The converse of p → q is q → p. You swap the hypothesis and conclusion. Note that an implication and its converse are not logically equivalent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the contrapositive of p → q?",
      "answer": "¬q → ¬p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p. An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the inverse of p → q?",
      "answer": "¬p → ¬q",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The inverse of p → q is ¬p → ¬q. You negate both the hypothesis and conclusion. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original implication."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which variant of an implication is logically equivalent to the original?",
      "answer": "Contrapositive",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Only the contrapositive (¬q → ¬p) is logically equivalent to the original implication (p → q). The converse and inverse are not equivalent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a necessary condition in p → q?",
      "answer": "q is necessary for p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "In p → q, q is a necessary condition for p. For p to be true, q must be true. We say 'p only if q' or 'q is necessary for p'."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a sufficient condition in p → q?",
      "answer": "p is sufficient for q",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "In p → q, p is a sufficient condition for q. If p is true, then q must be true. We say 'p is sufficient for q' or 'if p then q'."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can p → q be rewritten using only negation and disjunction?",
      "answer": "¬p ∨ q",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The implication p → q is logically equivalent to ¬p ∨ q. This is useful for simplifying logical expressions."
    },
    {
      "question": "If p → q is true and p is true, what can you conclude about q?",
      "answer": "q must be true (modus ponens)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "This is modus ponens, a valid argument form. If p → q is true and p is true, then q must be true. This is a fundamental rule of inference."
