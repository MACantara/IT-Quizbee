    {
      "question": "What method has CPU continuously check device status?",
      "answer": "Polling",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Polling repeatedly checks device status. It's simple but inefficient as it wastes CPU cycles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What signal notifies CPU of I/O completion?",
      "answer": "Interrupt",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Interrupts signal I/O events to the CPU. They eliminate continuous polling overhead."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique transfers data without CPU involvement?",
      "answer": "DMA",
      "alternatives": ["Direct Memory Access"],
      "explanation": "DMA allows devices to access memory directly. It frees the CPU during large transfers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What temporarily stores I/O data?",
      "answer": "Buffer",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Buffers hold data temporarily during I/O. They accommodate speed differences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What software controls hardware devices?",
      "answer": "Device driver",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Device drivers provide device-specific interfaces. They translate OS requests to hardware commands."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique queues printer jobs?",
      "answer": "Spooling",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Spooling queues output to disk for devices like printers. It prevents interleaved output."
    },
    {
      "question": "What uses memory addresses for device communication?",
      "answer": "Memory-mapped I/O",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Memory-mapped I/O assigns devices memory addresses. CPU uses standard memory instructions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What disk unit is the smallest addressable?",
      "answer": "Sector",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Sectors are disks' smallest addressable units. Disks read and write entire sectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What connects CPU to I/O devices?",
      "answer": "I/O bus",
      "alternatives": ["Bus"],
      "explanation": "I/O buses carry data between CPU and devices. They provide standardized interfaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique combines multiple disks?",
      "answer": "RAID",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RAID uses multiple disks for redundancy and performance. Different levels offer various benefits."
