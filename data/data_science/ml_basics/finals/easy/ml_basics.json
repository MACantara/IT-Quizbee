    {
      "question": "What type of learning uses labeled training data?",
      "answer": "Supervised learning",
      "alternatives": ["Supervised"],
      "explanation": "Supervised learning trains on examples with known correct answers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an input variable used for predictions called?",
      "answer": "Feature",
      "alternatives": ["Features", "Input variable"],
      "explanation": "Features are the characteristics used by models to make predictions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the output variable a model predicts?",
      "answer": "Target variable",
      "alternatives": ["Target", "Label", "Output"],
      "explanation": "The target variable is what the model is trained to predict."
    },
    {
      "question": "What occurs when a model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns?",
      "answer": "Overfitting",
      "alternatives": ["Overfit"],
      "explanation": "Overfitting results in poor performance on new, unseen data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What metric shows the proportion of correct predictions?",
      "answer": "Accuracy",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Accuracy measures how often the model predicts correctly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most popular Python machine learning library?",
      "answer": "scikit-learn",
      "alternatives": ["sklearn", "scikit learn"],
      "explanation": "scikit-learn provides extensive machine learning algorithms and tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "What learning type finds patterns without labeled data?",
      "answer": "Unsupervised learning",
      "alternatives": ["Unsupervised"],
      "explanation": "Unsupervised learning discovers hidden structures in unlabeled data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique splits data into training and testing portions?",
      "answer": "Train-test split",
      "alternatives": ["Train test split"],
      "explanation": "This separation allows evaluation on data the model hasn't seen."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique prevents overfitting by penalizing complexity?",
      "answer": "Regularization",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Regularization adds constraints to reduce model complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What validation method uses multiple data folds?",
      "answer": "Cross-validation",
      "alternatives": ["Cross validation", "K-fold cross-validation"],
      "explanation": "Cross-validation assesses model performance across multiple splits."
