Full funnel: Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Intent → Evaluation → Purchase → Loyalty → Advocacy. Metrics by stage: Awareness (impressions, reach, traffic), Consideration (engagement, time on site, leads), Conversion (sales, conversion rate, revenue). Strategies: (1) Top: content marketing, SEO, social media, (2) Middle: email nurturing, retargeting, webinars, (3) Bottom: demos, consultations, special offers.

      "explanation": "A/B testing (split testing) compares two versions of a webpage, email, ad, or other marketing asset to determine which performs better based on a specific metric.

What to test: (1) Headlines/copy, (2) CTA buttons (text, color, size, placement), (3) Images/videos, (4) Page layout, (5) Email subject lines, (6) Form fields (length, types), (7) Pricing displays, (8) Navigation. Metrics: conversion rate, click-through rate, bounce rate, time on page, revenue. Best practices: (1) Test one variable at a time (isolate impact), (2) Sufficient sample size (statistical significance), (3) Run long enough (account for variability), (4) Document results, (5) Continuous testing (optimization never ends). Tools: Google Optimize, Optimizely, VWO, Unbounce. Data-driven decision making over guesswork - small changes can yield significant improvements."

Types: (1) Site retargeting: visited website, (2) Search retargeting: searched keywords, (3) Social media retargeting: engaged with social content (Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag), (4) Email retargeting: opened emails, (5) Dynamic retargeting: show specific products viewed. Why effective: (1) Higher conversion rates (visitors need 5-7 impressions), (2) Brand recall, (3) Personalized messaging, (4) Cost-effective (targeting warm leads). Strategies: segment audiences (cart abandoners, product viewers, blog readers), sequential messaging (different ads over time), frequency caps (avoid ad fatigue), exclusions (recent purchasers). Platforms: Google Ads, Facebook Ads, AdRoll, Criteo. Critical for e-commerce (average 98% visitors don't convert first visit)."
