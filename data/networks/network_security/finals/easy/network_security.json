      "question": "What is a firewall?",
      "answer": "Network security barrier",
      "alternatives": [
        "Security barrier"
      ],
      "explanation": "Firewall: blocks unwanted traffic. Rules: allow/deny based on policy. Types: hardware, software. Layers: can operate at multiple. Purpose: network protection. Importance: first defense."

      "question": "What is an IDS?",
      "answer": "Intrusion Detection System",
      "alternatives": [
        "Attack detection"
      ],
      "explanation": "IDS: monitors for attacks. Alerts: notifies on suspicious activity. Types: NIDS (network), HIDS (host). Passive: detection only. Purpose: threat identification. Importance: security monitoring."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an IPS?",
      "answer": "Intrusion Prevention System",
      "alternatives": [
        "Attack prevention"
      ],
      "explanation": "IPS: blocks detected attacks. Active: takes action. Comparison: IDS alerts, IPS blocks. Deployment: inline mode. Purpose: real-time protection. Importance: active defense."

      "question": "What is DDoS?",
      "answer": "Distributed Denial of Service",
      "alternatives": [
        "Distributed attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "DDoS: overwhelm with traffic. Source: multiple machines. Target: single victim. Effect: unavailable service. Mitigation: filtering, rate limiting. Importance: major threat."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a DoS attack?",
      "answer": "Denial of Service",
      "alternatives": [
        "Service attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "DoS: prevent legitimate access. Methods: flooding, resource exhaustion. Source: single attacker. vs DDoS: multiple sources. Protection: traffic analysis. Importance: disruption attack."

      "question": "What is a VPN?",
      "answer": "Virtual Private Network",
      "alternatives": [
        "Encrypted tunnel"
      ],
      "explanation": "VPN: encrypted connection. Purpose: privacy, security. Remote: access private network. Protocols: OpenVPN, WireGuard. Encryption: AES common. Importance: privacy protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is encryption?",
      "answer": "Scrambling data for secrecy",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data scrambling"
      ],
      "explanation": "Encryption: readable to unreadable. Key: needed to decrypt. Purpose: confidentiality. Types: symmetric, asymmetric. Usage: HTTPS, VPN. Importance: data protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is symmetric encryption?",
      "answer": "Same key for encrypt/decrypt",
      "alternatives": [
        "Shared key"
      ],
      "explanation": "Symmetric: single key. Speed: fast. Key sharing: challenge. Examples: AES, DES. Size: 128-256 bits. Importance: performance critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is asymmetric encryption?",
      "answer": "Different keys for encrypt/decrypt",
      "alternatives": [
        "Public key"
      ],
      "explanation": "Asymmetric: public/private keys. Speed: slower than symmetric. Key distribution: easier. Examples: RSA, ECC. Size: 2048+ bits. Importance: key exchange."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a hash?",
      "answer": "Fixed-size data fingerprint",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data fingerprint"
      ],
      "explanation": "Hash: one-way function. Size: fixed output. Purpose: integrity, identity. Examples: SHA-256, MD5. Collision: unlikely with good hash. Importance: data integrity."
