      "question": "What technique anticipates needed I/O operations?",
      "answer": "I/O prefetching",
      "alternatives": [
        "Read-ahead"
      ],
      "explanation": "I/O prefetching loads data before explicit requests. It improves sequential access performance.",

    {
      "question": "What schedules I/O for minimal seek time?",
      "answer": "I/O scheduler",
      "alternatives": [
        "Disk scheduler"
      ],
      "explanation": "I/O schedulers reorder requests to minimize seek times. They balance fairness and performance.",

      "question": "What combines small writes into larger operations?",
      "answer": "Write coalescing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Write combining"
      ],
      "explanation": "Write coalescing merges adjacent writes. It reduces total I/O operations.",

      "question": "What RAID level provides both striping and mirroring?",
      "answer": "RAID 10",
      "alternatives": [
        "RAID 1+0"
      ],
      "explanation": "RAID 10 combines RAID 1 and RAID 0. It offers both redundancy and performance.",

    {
      "question": "What technique bypasses kernel buffering?",
      "answer": "Direct I/O",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Direct I/O transfers data straight between devices and user space. It avoids kernel buffer copies.",

      "question": "What optimizes disk writes by delaying and reordering?",
      "answer": "Write-back caching",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Write-back caching acknowledges writes before disk completion. It improves performance but risks data loss.",

      "question": "What ensures writes complete before acknowledging?",
      "answer": "Write-through caching",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Write-through caching waits for disk confirmation. It sacrifices performance for durability.",
