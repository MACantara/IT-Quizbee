    {
      "question": "What DMA component manages data transfers?",
      "answer": "DMA controller",
      "alternatives": ["DMAC"],
      "explanation": "DMA controllers handle transfers between devices and memory. They operate independently of the CPU."
    },
    {
      "question": "What uses separate address spaces for devices?",
      "answer": "Port-mapped I/O",
      "alternatives": ["Isolated I/O"],
      "explanation": "Port-mapped I/O uses special instructions for device access. It separates I/O from memory address space."
    },
    {
      "question": "What channel handles one high-speed device?",
      "answer": "Selector channel",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Selector channels dedicate themselves to single fast devices. They're used for disks and tapes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What RAID level provides mirroring?",
      "answer": "RAID 1",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RAID 1 mirrors data across disks. It provides redundancy but doubles storage cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "What RAID level uses striping with parity?",
      "answer": "RAID 5",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RAID 5 stripes data and distributes parity across disks. It balances performance and redundancy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What disk group shares the same cylinder?",
      "answer": "Cylinder",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Cylinders are tracks at the same position on all platters. They can be read without head movement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What arranges data on disk for sequential access?",
      "answer": "Track",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Tracks are circular paths on disk platters. Each track holds many sectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What reduces disk latency through caching?",
      "answer": "Disk cache",
      "alternatives": ["Buffer cache"],
      "explanation": "Disk caches store frequently accessed data in memory. They dramatically reduce access times."
    },
    {
      "question": "What operation flushes cached writes to disk?",
      "answer": "Sync",
      "alternatives": ["Flush", "Fsync"],
      "explanation": "Sync operations force cached data to permanent storage. They ensure durability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What I/O mode allows process continuation before completion?",
      "answer": "Asynchronous I/O",
      "alternatives": ["Non-blocking I/O"],
      "explanation": "Asynchronous I/O returns immediately, allowing concurrent work. Completion is signaled later."
