    {
      "question": "What is universal quantification?",
      "answer": "x means for all x",
      "alternatives": [
        "Universal"
      ],
      "explanation": "Quantifier: . Meaning: statement applies to all domain elements. Notation: x P(x). Scope: all x. Example: 'All humans are mortal'. Truth: true only if all satisfy. Importance: expressing universals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is existential quantification?",
      "answer": "x means there exists x",
      "alternatives": [
        "Existential"
      ],
      "explanation": "Quantifier: . Meaning: at least one element satisfies. Notation: x P(x). Scope: at least one x. Example: 'Some humans are mortal'. Truth: true if any satisfy. Importance: expressing existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is scope?",
      "answer": "Range of quantifier application",
      "alternatives": [
        "Quantifier range"
      ],
      "explanation": "Scope: region where quantifier applies. Notation: typically right side after quantifier. Ambiguity: scope matters for meaning. Example: x (P(x)Q(x)) vs (x P(x))Q(x). Importance: disambiguation. Precedence: quantifiers bind tightly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is domain?",
      "answer": "Set over which quantifier ranges",
      "alternatives": [
        "Universe of discourse"
      ],
      "explanation": "Domain: what x refers to. Example: all humans, all numbers. Notation: often implicit. Importance: determines truth. Difference: 'All unicorns are white' depends on including unicorns. Varies: by context."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a bound variable?",
      "answer": "Variable bound by quantifier",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bound occurrence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Variable: occurrence within quantifier scope. Example: x in x P(x). Scope: quantifier extends over it. Contrast: free variable unbound. Importance: distinguishing binding. Notation: x is bound."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a free variable?",
      "answer": "Variable not bound by quantifier",
      "alternatives": [
        "Free occurrence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Variable: no enclosing quantifier. Example: y in x P(x,y). Scope: y unbound. Contrast: x is bound. Importance: distinguishing binding. Implication: truth depends on y's value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is negation of universal?",
      "answer": "x P(x)  x P(x)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Universal negation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: negating universal gives existential. Proof: logical law. Example: 'Not all are mortal'  'Some not mortal'. Application: formula transformation. Importance: negation rule."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is negation of existential?",
      "answer": "x P(x)  x P(x)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Existential negation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: negating existential gives universal. Proof: logical law. Example: 'Not any exist'  'All don't exist'. Application: formula transformation. Importance: negation rule."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is quantifier equivalence?",
      "answer": "Equivalent expressions in quantified logic",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical equivalence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: same truth value. Methods: truth table, rules. Laws: negation, scope. Proof: logical derivation. Application: simplification. Importance: logical reasoning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a predicate?",
      "answer": "Function mapping elements to truth values",
      "alternatives": [
        "Propositional function"
      ],
      "explanation": "Predicate: P(x) true/false depending on x. Example: 'x is even' true for 2, false for 3. Notation: P(x), Q(x,y), etc. Arity: number of arguments. Importance: foundation for first-order logic."
