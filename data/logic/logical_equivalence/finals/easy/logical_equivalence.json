    {
      "question": "What does it mean for two statements to be logically equivalent?",
      "answer": "They have the same truth value in all possible cases",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in all possible cases. This is denoted by p ≡ q or p ⇔ q."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following pairs are logically equivalent?",
      "answer": "p → q and ¬p ∨ q",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The implication p → q is logically equivalent to ¬p ∨ q. This can be verified using truth tables or logical laws."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is De Morgan's first law?",
      "answer": "¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "De Morgan's first law states that ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q. The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is De Morgan's second law?",
      "answer": "¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "De Morgan's second law states that ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q. The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of p → q?",
      "answer": "¬q → ¬p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p, and they are logically equivalent. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the converse of an implication logically equivalent to the original implication?",
      "answer": "No, they are not equivalent",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The converse (q → p) is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication (p → q). They can have different truth values."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the double negation law?",
      "answer": "¬¬p ≡ p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The double negation law states that ¬¬p ≡ p. Negating a proposition twice returns you to the original proposition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement is logically equivalent to p ↔ q?",
      "answer": "(p → q) ∧ (q → p)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The biconditional p ↔ q is logically equivalent to (p → q) ∧ (q → p). It means both implications must hold true."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you prove two statements are logically equivalent?",
      "answer": "Show their truth tables are identical",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Two statements are logically equivalent if their truth tables produce identical results for all possible input combinations. You can also use logical laws to transform one into the other."
    },
    {
      "question": "What symbol is commonly used to denote logical equivalence?",
      "answer": "≡ or ⇔",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Logical equivalence is denoted by ≡ or ⇔. When we write p ≡ q, it means p and q have the same truth value in all cases."
