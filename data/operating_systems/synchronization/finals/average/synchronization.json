      "question": "What classical problem involves producers creating items and consumers using them?",
      "answer": "Producer-Consumer problem",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bounded buffer problem"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Producer-Consumer problem coordinates data production and consumption. It requires synchronizing buffer access.",

      "question": "What monitor construct suspends processes until conditions are met?",
      "answer": "Condition variable",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Condition variables enable processes to wait for specific conditions. They work with wait and signal operations.",

    {
      "question": "What requirement limits waiting time for critical section entry?",
      "answer": "Bounded waiting",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Bounded waiting guarantees processes enter critical sections within finite time. It prevents starvation.",

      "question": "What condition ensures critical section selection proceeds?",
      "answer": "Progress",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Progress guarantees critical section entry decisions occur. Processes outside can't block indefinitely.",

      "question": "What technique disables interrupts to achieve atomicity?",
      "answer": "Interrupt disabling",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Disabling interrupts prevents context switches during critical sections. It's simple but affects system responsiveness.",
