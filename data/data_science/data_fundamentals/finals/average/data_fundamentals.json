    {
      "question": "What type of data can take any value within a range?",
      "answer": "Continuous data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Continuous variable"
      ],
      "explanation": "Continuous data can take any value within a range, limited only by measurement precision. Examples include height (175.5cm), temperature (98.6Â°F), or time (3.14 seconds). Continuous data is typically measured rather than counted and can be infinitely subdivided."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of data can only take specific, countable values?",
      "answer": "Discrete data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Discrete variable"
      ],
      "explanation": "Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values that can be counted. Examples include number of students, cars, or clicks. Discrete data often involves integers and cannot be meaningfully subdivided (you can't have 2.5 students). It's typically counted rather than measured."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the dimensionality problem that occurs with too many features?",
      "answer": "Curse of dimensionality",
      "alternatives": [
        "High dimensionality"
      ],
      "explanation": "The curse of dimensionality refers to problems arising when data has too many features/dimensions. As dimensions increase, data becomes sparse, distances become less meaningful, and more data is needed to maintain statistical significance. This affects machine learning performance, requiring dimensionality reduction techniques."
    },
    {
      "question": "What term describes data with both structured and unstructured elements?",
      "answer": "Semi-structured data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Hybrid data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Semi-structured data has some organizational properties but doesn't fit neatly into tables. Examples include JSON, XML, and email (with structured headers and unstructured body). It's more flexible than structured data but more organized than purely unstructured data like images or videos."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is data that doesn't fit into predefined models or schemas?",
      "answer": "Unstructured data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Non-structured data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Unstructured data lacks a predefined format or organization, making it difficult to process with traditional databases. Examples include text documents, images, videos, and social media posts. Unstructured data comprises about 80% of organizational data and requires specialized tools like NLP or computer vision for analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What statistical concept describes the center point of a data distribution?",
      "answer": "Central tendency",
      "alternatives": [
        "Average"
      ],
      "explanation": "Central tendency measures identify the center or typical value of a dataset. The three main measures are mean (arithmetic average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value). Each provides different insights and is appropriate for different data types and distributions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What measures how spread out data values are from the center?",
      "answer": "Dispersion",
      "alternatives": [
        "Variability",
        "Spread"
      ],
      "explanation": "Dispersion (or variability) quantifies how scattered data values are from the central value. Common measures include range (max - min), variance (average squared deviation), and standard deviation (square root of variance). High dispersion indicates data points are spread widely; low dispersion indicates clustering near the center."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the format where each row represents a unique entity with attributes in columns?",
      "answer": "Tidy data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Long format",
        "Normalized data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Tidy data follows principles where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This format simplifies analysis and visualization in tools like R and Python. Converting data to tidy format is often the first step in data cleaning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of relationship exists when one variable increases as another increases?",
      "answer": "Positive correlation",
      "alternatives": [
        "Direct correlation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Positive correlation occurs when two variables tend to move in the same direction - as one increases, the other tends to increase. Examples include height and weight, or study time and test scores. Correlation measures range from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating positive relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "What principle states that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes?",
      "answer": "Pareto Principle",
      "alternatives": [
        "80-20 rule"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Pareto Principle (80-20 rule) observes that roughly 80% of outcomes result from 20% of inputs. In data analysis, this might mean 80% of sales come from 20% of customers, or 80% of errors from 20% of bugs. This principle helps prioritize analysis and interventions on high-impact factors."
