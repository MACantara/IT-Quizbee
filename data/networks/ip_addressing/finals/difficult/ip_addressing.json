    {
      "question": "How many bits are used in an IPv4 address?",
      "answer": "32 bits",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "IPv4 addresses use 32 bits, typically represented as four octets in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Each octet contains 8 bits, allowing values from 0 to 255. This provides approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a valid private IP address range defined in RFC 1918?",
      "answer": "192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RFC 1918 defines three private IP address ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. These addresses are not routable on the public internet and are used for internal networks. NAT is used to translate private addresses to public addresses."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the subnet mask for a /24 network in CIDR notation?",
      "answer": "255.255.255.0",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A /24 network has 24 bits for the network portion, leaving 8 bits for hosts. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. This provides 254 usable host addresses (256 total minus network and broadcast addresses)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many bits are used in an IPv6 address?",
      "answer": "128 bits",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "IPv6 addresses use 128 bits, represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). This provides approximately 340 undecillion unique addresses, solving IPv4 address exhaustion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of a subnet mask?",
      "answer": "To determine which portion of an IP address represents the network and which represents the host",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A subnet mask determines which portion of an IP address identifies the network and which identifies individual hosts. It's used in conjunction with IP addresses for routing decisions and network segmentation. Devices use it to determine if a destination is on the local network or requires routing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which IP address class has the first octet range of 192-223?",
      "answer": "Class C",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Class C addresses have the first octet in the range 192-223. They use a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24), providing 254 usable host addresses per network. Class C was designed for small networks, though classful addressing is largely replaced by CIDR."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does NAT (Network Address Translation) do?",
      "answer": "Translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice versa",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "NAT translates private IP addresses used within a local network to public IP addresses for internet communication. This allows multiple devices with private IPs to share a single public IP address, conserving IPv4 addresses and providing a layer of security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a loopback address used for?",
      "answer": "To test network connectivity to the local machine itself",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The loopback address (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6) is used to test network connectivity to the local machine itself. Traffic sent to this address doesn't leave the device, making it useful for testing network applications and troubleshooting without requiring network access."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many usable host addresses are available in a /26 subnet?",
      "answer": "62",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A /26 subnet uses 26 bits for the network portion, leaving 6 bits for hosts. This provides 2^6 = 64 total addresses. Subtracting the network address and broadcast address leaves 62 usable host addresses. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.192."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)?",
      "answer": "A method for allocating IP addresses and routing that replaces classful addressing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing that replaced the older classful addressing system. It uses variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) and is expressed with a slash notation (e.g., /24) indicating the number of network bits. CIDR allows more efficient use of IP address space."
