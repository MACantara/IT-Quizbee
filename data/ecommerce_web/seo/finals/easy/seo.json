      "question": "What does SEO stand for and what is its purpose?",
      "answer": "Search Engine Optimization",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of improving website visibility and ranking in organic (non-paid) search engine results to increase quality traffic. Goals: (1) Higher rankings for relevant keywords, (2) Increased organic traffic, (3) Better user experience, (4) Higher conversion rates. How search works: crawling (discover pages), indexing (analyze and store), ranking (order results by relevance/quality). SEO categories: (1) On-page: content, keywords, meta tags, headings, URLs, (2) Off-page: backlinks, social signals, brand mentions, (3) Technical: site speed, mobile-friendliness, HTTPS, structured data, crawlability. Unlike paid ads (SEM/PPC), SEO builds long-term organic presence. Key factors: content quality, relevance, authority, user experience. ROI: cost-effective long-term traffic source. Constant evolution with algorithm updates (Google changes 500-600 times yearly)."

      "question": "What are keywords in SEO?",
      "answer": "Words and phrases users type into search engines that websites target to rank for",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Keywords are words and phrases users enter into search engines when looking for information, products, or services. Websites optimize content around keywords to rank when users search those terms. Types: (1) Short-tail: 1-2 words, high volume, competitive, broad ('shoes'), (2) Long-tail: 3+ words, lower volume, less competitive, specific ('women's waterproof hiking boots size 8'), (3) LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing): related terms adding context. Keyword research: tools (Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, Ahrefs) identify search volume, competition, intent. Search intent: informational (learn), navigational (find site), transactional (buy), commercial (compare). Best practices: natural integration, avoid keyword stuffing, focus on user intent, target primary and secondary keywords, use in titles, headings, content, meta descriptions, URLs. Modern SEO: semantic search understands context, not just exact matches."

      "question": "What are meta tags and why are they important for SEO?",
      "answer": "HTML tags providing metadata about web pages, crucial for search engines and social media",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Meta tags are HTML elements in the <head> section providing metadata about web pages to search engines and other services. Key meta tags: (1) Title tag (<title>): most important, appears in SERPs and browser tabs, 50-60 characters, includes primary keyword, unique per page. (2) Meta description (<meta name='description'>): summary for SERPs, 150-160 characters, influences click-through rate (CTR) but not rankings directly, compelling call-to-action. (3) Meta robots (<meta name='robots' content='index,follow'>): controls indexing and link following. (4) Viewport (<meta name='viewport'>): mobile responsiveness. (5) Charset (<meta charset='UTF-8'>): character encoding. Open Graph and Twitter Card tags: rich social media previews. Best practices: unique, descriptive, keyword-optimized, compelling. Title and description are first impressions in search results - impact CTR significantly. Don't ignore meta keywords (obsolete, ignored by Google since 2009)."

      "question": "What is backlinking and why is it important?",
      "answer": "External websites linking to your site, signaling credibility and authority to search engines",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Backlinks (inbound/incoming links) are links from external websites pointing to your site, considered 'votes of confidence' by search engines. Why important: (1) Authority: quality backlinks signal trustworthiness, (2) Rankings: major Google ranking factor (PageRank algorithm), (3) Referral traffic: users click through from other sites, (4) Faster indexing: crawlers discover your site through links. Link quality factors: (1) Authority: links from high-authority domains (DA/DR scores) more valuable, (2) Relevance: links from topically related sites, (3) Dofollow vs. nofollow: dofollow passes 'link juice', (4) Anchor text: clickable text describing destination, (5) Diversity: natural link profile from varied sources. Earning backlinks: quality content, guest posting, broken link building, digital PR, resource pages. Avoid: buying links, link farms, spammy directories (black hat SEO = penalties). Quality over quantity."

      "question": "What is on-page SEO?",
      "answer": "Optimization of elements within your website's pages (content, HTML, structure) to improve rankings",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "On-page SEO (on-site SEO) involves optimizing elements within your website's pages to improve search rankings and user experience. Key elements: (1) Content quality: original, valuable, comprehensive, answers search intent, proper length, (2) Title tags: unique, descriptive, keyword-optimized (50-60 chars), (3) Headings (H1-H6): hierarchical structure, H1 for main topic, keywords in headings, (4) Meta descriptions: compelling summaries (150-160 chars), (5) URL structure: short, descriptive, keyword-rich (example.com/seo-guide), (6) Internal linking: links between your pages, distributes authority, improves navigation, (7) Image optimization: descriptive file names, alt text, compression, (8) Keyword usage: natural integration, semantic variations, (9) Schema markup: structured data for rich snippets. Content tips: E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), regular updates, multimedia, mobile-friendly. You control on-page elements directly, unlike off-page (backlinks)."

      "question": "What is technical SEO?",
      "answer": "Optimizing website infrastructure to help search engines crawl, index, and understand your site",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Technical SEO optimizes website infrastructure and backend elements to help search engines crawl, index, and interpret your site effectively. Key areas: (1) Crawlability: robots.txt (control crawler access), XML sitemap (guide crawlers), proper site structure, (2) Indexability: canonical tags (prevent duplicate content), noindex tags (exclude pages), status codes (301 redirects, 404 handling), (3) Site speed: page load time major ranking factor, Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS), image optimization, minification, CDN, caching, (4) Mobile-friendliness: responsive design, mobile-first indexing, (5) HTTPS: SSL certificate, secure connection (ranking signal), (6) Structured data: Schema markup for rich snippets (reviews, recipes, FAQs), (7) URL structure: clean, descriptive, hierarchical, (8) Site architecture: logical hierarchy, internal linking. Tools: Google Search Console, PageSpeed Insights, Screaming Frog. Technical SEO foundations enable content and off-page efforts to succeed."

      "question": "What is Google PageRank?",
      "answer": "An algorithm measuring web page importance based on quantity and quality of links pointing to it",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "PageRank is Google's original algorithm (created by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, 1996) that revolutionized search by measuring web page importance based on the link graph. Core concept: pages with more high-quality backlinks are more important. How it works: (1) Links are votes of confidence, (2) Votes from important pages count more (recursive), (3) Link juice distributed across outgoing links, (4) Scores 0-10 (logarithmic scale, 10 extremely rare). Formula considers: link quantity, source authority, link diversity, anchor text. Modern evolution: PageRank still part of Google's algorithm but one of 200+ ranking factors, no longer publicly displayed (toolbar removed 2016), replaced by more sophisticated signals (RankBrain AI, BERT NLP, E-E-A-T, user engagement). Legacy: established backlinks as crucial SEO factor, foundation for link building strategies. Focus now: quality over quantity, natural link profiles, diverse sources."

    {
      "question": "What is a sitemap and why is it important?",
      "answer": "An XML/HTML file listing website pages to help search engines discover and crawl content efficiently",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A sitemap is a file listing all important pages on your website, helping search engines discover, crawl, and index your content efficiently. Types: (1) XML sitemap: for search engines, lists URLs with metadata (last modified, change frequency, priority), submit to Google Search Console/Bing Webmaster, especially important for: large sites, new sites, sites with poor internal linking, frequently updated content, (2) HTML sitemap: for users, visual page hierarchy, improves navigation. XML sitemap structure: <urlset> containing <url> entries with <loc> (URL), <lastmod> (last modified), <changefreq> (update frequency), <priority> (relative importance 0.0-1.0). Best practices: include only canonical URLs, exclude noindex pages, update regularly (or dynamic generation), split large sitemaps (50,000 URLs max), use sitemap index for multiple sitemaps. Not a guarantee of indexing but guides crawlers efficiently. Critical for SEO foundation."

      "question": "What are Core Web Vitals?",
      "answer": "Google's metrics measuring page speed and user experience: LCP, FID, CLS",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Core Web Vitals are Google's metrics quantifying essential aspects of user experience, specifically page speed and visual stability. Three metrics (part of Page Experience update 2021): (1) LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): loading performance, measures time until largest content element (image, text block) renders, target <2.5 seconds, affects perceived load speed, (2) FID (First Input Delay, replaced by INP - Interaction to Next Paint in 2024): interactivity, measures time from first user interaction (click, tap) to browser response, target <100ms, affects responsiveness, (3) CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): visual stability, measures unexpected layout shifts, target <0.1, prevents accidental clicks. Why important: ranking factor, impacts user experience, reduces bounce rate, increases conversions. Optimization: optimize images/videos, minimize JavaScript, use CDN, leverage browser caching, specify dimensions for media, avoid layout shifts. Tools: Google PageSpeed Insights, Search Console, Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools. Balance: performance + content quality both matter."

      "question": "What is the difference between white hat and black hat SEO?",
      "answer": "White hat uses ethical, guideline-compliant tactics; black hat uses manipulative, risky tactics violating guidelines",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "White hat vs. black hat SEO differs in ethics and compliance with search engine guidelines. White hat SEO: ethical tactics complying with search engine guidelines, focuses on human audience, provides value, sustainable long-term growth, low risk. Techniques: quality content, keyword research, proper HTML markup, earning quality backlinks, good UX, mobile optimization, proper site structure. Black hat SEO: manipulative tactics violating guidelines, exploits algorithm loopholes, short-term gains, high penalty risk, poor user experience. Techniques: keyword stuffing, cloaking (showing different content to search engines), hidden text, link farms, content scraping, doorway pages, negative SEO. Consequences: penalties (manual or algorithmic), de-indexing, brand damage, traffic loss. Gray hat: risky but not clearly prohibited (buying expired domains, clickbait). Recommendation: always white hat - sustainable, ethical, builds real value. Black hat may work temporarily but inevitable penalties destroy long-term success."
