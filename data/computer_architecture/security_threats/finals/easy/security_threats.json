      "question": "What malicious software is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system?",
      "answer": "Malware",
      "alternatives": [
        "Malicious software"
      ],
      "explanation": "Malware is an umbrella term for any software intentionally designed to cause harm. Types include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can steal data, encrypt files for ransom, consume resources, or provide backdoor access to attackers. Antivirus software and safe computing practices help prevent infections."

    {
      "question": "What type of malware disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installing it?",
      "answer": "Trojan",
      "alternatives": [
        "Trojan horse"
      ],
      "explanation": "Trojans (named after the Greek wooden horse) appear to be useful programs but contain hidden malicious functionality. Unlike viruses, trojans don't replicate themselves. They might disguise as games, utilities, or email attachments. Once installed, they can steal data, download additional malware, or create backdoors for remote access."

    {
      "question": "What attack involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source?",
      "answer": "Phishing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Phishing attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities through email, text messages, or fake websites to trick victims into revealing credentials, financial information, or installing malware. Spear phishing targets specific individuals with personalized attacks. Education and email filtering help combat phishing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What malicious software replicates itself and spreads to other computers without user intervention?",
      "answer": "Worm",
      "alternatives": [
        "Computer worm"
      ],
      "explanation": "Worms are self-replicating malware that spread automatically across networks without user action. Unlike viruses (which require a host file), worms are standalone programs. They exploit vulnerabilities to propagate, consuming network bandwidth and system resources. Famous examples include Morris Worm, Code Red, and WannaCry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack overwhelms a system with traffic to make it unavailable to legitimate users?",
      "answer": "DoS attack",
      "alternatives": [
        "Denial of Service",
        "DDoS",
        "Denial of Service attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks flood systems with excessive requests, consuming resources and preventing legitimate access. Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks use many compromised computers (botnets) to amplify the attack. Defenses include rate limiting, traffic filtering, and DDoS protection services that absorb attack traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of malware encrypts files and demands payment for decryption?",
      "answer": "Ransomware",
      "alternatives": [
        "Crypto-ransomware"
      ],
      "explanation": "Ransomware encrypts victim files or locks systems, demanding ransom (typically cryptocurrency) for the decryption key. Notable examples include WannaCry and CryptoLocker. Prevention includes regular backups, security updates, and email filtering. Paying ransom doesn't guarantee file recovery and encourages attackers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What vulnerability exploitation occurs before the software vendor is aware of it?",
      "answer": "Zero-day exploit",
      "alternatives": [
        "Zero-day attack",
        "0-day"
      ],
      "explanation": "Zero-day exploits target previously unknown vulnerabilities before vendors can create patches. These are particularly dangerous because no defense exists yet. Attackers may discover these vulnerabilities themselves or purchase them on dark markets. Organizations use defense-in-depth strategies to limit zero-day impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge?",
      "answer": "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "alternatives": [
        "MITM",
        "Interception attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks occur when attackers secretly intercept and possibly alter communication between two parties who believe they're directly communicating. Attackers can eavesdrop or inject malicious content. HTTPS, VPNs, and certificate validation help prevent MITM attacks by ensuring communication authenticity and encryption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What malicious software secretly monitors and records user activity?",
      "answer": "Spyware",
      "alternatives": [
        "Surveillance software"
      ],
      "explanation": "Spyware covertly monitors user activities, collecting sensitive information like passwords, browsing habits, credit card numbers, or keystrokes. It transmits this data to attackers without user knowledge. Keyloggers are a specific type of spyware recording keystrokes. Anti-malware software can detect and remove spyware."
    },
    {
      "question": "What social engineering attack involves creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information?",
      "answer": "Pretexting",
      "alternatives": [
        "Pretext attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to manipulate victims into divulging information or performing actions. Attackers might impersonate IT support, executives, or authorities to gain trust. Unlike phishing which uses deception, pretexting involves more elaborate interaction and storytelling. Training helps employees recognize and resist pretexting."
