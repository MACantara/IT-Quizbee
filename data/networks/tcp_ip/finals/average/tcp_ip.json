      "answer": "SYN-ACK",
      "alternatives": ["syn ack", "synchronize acknowledge"],
      "explanation": "The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet to acknowledge the request."

    {
      "question": "What is the third step in the TCP three-way handshake?",
      "answer": "ACK",
      "alternatives": ["acknowledge", "acknowledgment"],
      "explanation": "The client sends an ACK packet to complete the connection establishment."

      "question": "What TCP feature ensures data arrives in order?",
      "answer": "sequence numbers",
      "alternatives": ["sequencing", "sequence numbering"],
      "explanation": "TCP uses sequence numbers to maintain data order and detect missing packets."
