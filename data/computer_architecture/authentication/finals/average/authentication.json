    {
      "question": "What protocol allows authentication across different domains using security tokens?",
      "answer": "SAML",
      "alternatives": [
        "Security Assertion Markup Language"
      ],
      "explanation": "SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers and service providers. It enables SSO across different domains and is widely used in enterprise environments for federated authentication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack involves trying many passwords rapidly until finding the correct one?",
      "answer": "Brute force attack",
      "alternatives": [
        "Password brute force"
      ],
      "explanation": "Brute force attacks systematically try all possible password combinations until finding the correct one. Defense mechanisms include account lockouts after failed attempts, rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, and requiring strong passwords. The attack's effectiveness decreases exponentially with password length and complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication method uses cryptographic keys instead of passwords?",
      "answer": "Public key authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "PKI authentication",
        "Certificate-based authentication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Public key authentication uses asymmetric cryptography where users possess a private key and share a public key. The system verifies identity by checking if the user possesses the private key corresponding to the registered public key. This is more secure than passwords and is used in SSH, SSL/TLS certificates, and digital signatures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack tricks users into revealing their credentials by impersonating legitimate services?",
      "answer": "Phishing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Phishing attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities (banks, companies, colleagues) to trick victims into revealing credentials or sensitive information. Common vectors include emails, fake websites, and text messages. Education, email filtering, and multi-factor authentication help defend against phishing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What standard describes time-based one-time passwords using HMAC?",
      "answer": "TOTP",
      "alternatives": [
        "Time-based One-Time Password"
      ],
      "explanation": "TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is an algorithm that generates one-time passwords using the current time and a shared secret key. The code changes every 30 seconds, making it secure against replay attacks. Google Authenticator and similar apps implement TOTP for 2FA."
    },
    {
      "question": "What OAuth flow is used for server-side web applications to obtain access tokens?",
      "answer": "Authorization Code flow",
      "alternatives": [
        "Authorization Code grant"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Authorization Code flow is OAuth 2.0's most secure flow for server-side applications. Users authenticate with the authorization server, which redirects back with a code. The application exchanges this code for an access token server-to-server, keeping tokens secure on the backend. This prevents token exposure to browsers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack exploits weakly hashed passwords using precomputed tables?",
      "answer": "Rainbow table attack",
      "alternatives": [
        "Rainbow table"
      ],
      "explanation": "Rainbow table attacks use precomputed tables of password hashes to quickly crack hashed passwords. Attackers compare stolen hashes against the rainbow table to find matching passwords. Salting (adding random data before hashing) defeats rainbow tables by making each hash unique, requiring attackers to recompute tables for each salt."
    },
    {
      "question": "What authentication mechanism uses a centralized server to validate credentials in large networks?",
      "answer": "RADIUS",
      "alternatives": [
        "Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service"
      ],
      "explanation": "RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a networking protocol providing centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network access. It's commonly used for WiFi networks, VPNs, and ISP access, allowing centralized user management and policy enforcement across distributed systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What newer authentication protocol provides better security than RADIUS with modern encryption?",
      "answer": "DIAMETER",
      "alternatives": [
        "DIAMETER protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "DIAMETER is the successor to RADIUS, designed for modern networks with improved security (mandatory encryption), reliability (TCP/SCTP instead of UDP), and capability negotiation. Despite the name, DIAMETER isn't exactly twice as good as RADIUS - the name is a play on words. It's used in mobile networks and IMS."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack captures authentication tokens to replay them and gain unauthorized access?",
      "answer": "Session hijacking",
      "alternatives": [
        "Session replay attack",
        "Cookie hijacking"
      ],
      "explanation": "Session hijacking occurs when an attacker captures or predicts a valid session token to impersonate an authenticated user. Methods include network sniffing, XSS attacks, or session fixation. Defenses include HTTPS encryption, secure cookie flags, short session timeouts, and binding sessions to IP addresses or user agents."
