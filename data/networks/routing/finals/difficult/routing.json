    {
      "question": "What technique does split horizon use to prevent routing loops?",
      "answer": "suppressing route advertisements",
      "alternatives": ["not advertising back", "route suppression", "reverse path suppression"],
      "explanation": "Split horizon prevents advertising routes back to the interface they were learned from."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does DUAL stand for in EIGRP?",
      "answer": "Diffusing Update Algorithm",
      "alternatives": ["diffusing update algorithm"],
      "explanation": "DUAL is EIGRP's algorithm for determining loop-free paths and backup routes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What OSPF packet type is used to discover neighbors?",
      "answer": "Hello packet",
      "alternatives": ["hello", "OSPF hello"],
      "explanation": "Hello packets establish and maintain OSPF neighbor relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the time for routers to reach consistent routing information called?",
      "answer": "convergence",
      "alternatives": ["network convergence", "routing convergence"],
      "explanation": "Convergence is when all routers have complete and accurate routing information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What BGP attribute indicates the path through autonomous systems?",
      "answer": "AS Path",
      "alternatives": ["AS_PATH", "autonomous system path"],
      "explanation": "The AS Path attribute lists all ASes a route has traversed, preventing loops."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique allows EIGRP to use unequal-cost load balancing?",
      "answer": "variance",
      "alternatives": ["variance command", "unequal load balancing"],
      "explanation": "Variance allows EIGRP to distribute traffic across paths with different metrics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What database does OSPF use to store the network topology?",
      "answer": "link-state database",
      "alternatives": ["LSDB", "topology database"],
      "explanation": "The link-state database contains all LSAs describing the complete network topology."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the administrative distance of OSPF?",
      "answer": "110",
      "alternatives": ["one hundred ten"],
      "explanation": "OSPF has an administrative distance of 110, indicating its trustworthiness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique prevents routing information from incorrect sources?",
      "answer": "route authentication",
      "alternatives": ["routing authentication", "MD5 authentication"],
      "explanation": "Route authentication ensures routing updates come from trusted sources."
    },
    {
      "question": "What BGP session type is established between routers in different ASes?",
      "answer": "eBGP",
      "alternatives": ["external BGP", "External BGP"],
      "explanation": "External BGP sessions connect routers in different autonomous systems."
