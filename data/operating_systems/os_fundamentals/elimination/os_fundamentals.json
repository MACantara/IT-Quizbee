    {
      "question": "What is an operating system?",
      "options": [
        "Software that manages hardware and provides services for application programs",
        "A type of application software",
        "Hardware component",
        "A programming language"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and hardware."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main functions of an operating system?",
      "options": [
        "Only managing files",
        "Resource management, process management, memory management, and security",
        "Only running applications",
        "Only providing a user interface"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The OS performs multiple functions: managing hardware resources (CPU, memory, I/O), managing processes, handling memory allocation, providing security, managing files, and offering user interfaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the kernel?",
      "options": [
        "A type of hardware",
        "An application program",
        "The core component of an OS that manages system resources",
        "A user interface"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The kernel is the central core of an operating system. It has complete control over everything in the system, managing CPU, memory, and I/O devices. It runs in privileged mode (kernel mode)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between kernel mode and user mode?",
      "options": [
        "No difference",
        "User mode is faster",
        "Kernel mode is only for applications",
        "Kernel mode has unrestricted access to hardware; user mode has restricted access"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Kernel mode (privileged mode) allows unrestricted access to all hardware and system resources. User mode (unprivileged mode) restricts access to prevent user programs from interfering with critical system operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a system call?",
      "options": [
        "An interface that allows user programs to request services from the kernel",
        "A function call within an application",
        "A hardware interrupt",
        "A type of error"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A system call is a programmatic way for a user-level program to request a service from the operating system's kernel. Examples include file operations (open, read, write), process control (fork, exec), and communication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a monolithic kernel?",
      "options": [
        "A kernel split into multiple separate processes",
        "A kernel where all OS services run in kernel space as a single program",
        "A kernel with no services",
        "A kernel that runs in user mode"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A monolithic kernel is an OS architecture where the entire operating system runs in kernel space with all services (file system, drivers, memory management) in one large executable. Linux is an example."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a microkernel?",
      "options": [
        "A very small computer",
        "A kernel with all services",
        "A minimal kernel where most services run in user space",
        "A type of application"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A microkernel is an OS architecture where the kernel provides only minimal services (IPC, basic scheduling, memory management), while most services (drivers, file systems) run as separate user-space processes. Examples: MINIX, QNX."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an interrupt?",
      "options": [
        "A program error",
        "A type of virus",
        "A user command",
        "A signal to the CPU indicating an event requiring immediate attention"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "An interrupt is a signal sent to the CPU by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. The CPU suspends its current activities, saves its state, and executes an interrupt handler."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the boot process?",
      "options": [
        "The sequence of steps that loads the OS into memory when a computer starts",
        "Shutting down the computer",
        "Installing software",
        "Running an application"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The boot process (bootstrapping) is the initialization sequence that loads the operating system when a computer powers on. It typically involves: BIOS/UEFI → bootloader → kernel loading → initialization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a device driver?",
      "options": [
        "A type of hardware",
        "Software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware devices",
        "A user application",
        "A type of CPU"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A device driver is specialized software that enables the operating system to interact with hardware devices. It translates generic OS commands into device-specific operations, acting as a translator between the OS and hardware."
