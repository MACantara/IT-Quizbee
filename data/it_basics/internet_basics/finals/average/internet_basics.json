    {
      "question": "What is TCP/IP?",
      "answer": "Internet protocol suite",
      "alternatives": [
        "Transmission Control Protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "TCP/IP: fundamental internet protocols. TCP: reliable packet delivery. IP: packet routing, addressing. Layers: transport, internet, link. Usage: basis for HTTP, FTP, SMTP. Standards: RFC documents define. Dominance: de facto internet standard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are ports?",
      "answer": "Logical communication endpoints",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network ports"
      ],
      "explanation": "Ports: identify services on devices. Numbers: 0-65535 range. Well-known: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH). Purpose: route traffic to applications. Firewalls: can block port access. Dynamic: temporary port assignment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is DHCP?",
      "answer": "Automatic IP assignment",
      "alternatives": [
        "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "DHCP: automatically assigns IP addresses. Process: lease-based temporarily. Duration: varies by configuration. Benefits: simplifies network management. Alternatives: static IP manual assignment. Importance: essential for large networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a VPN?",
      "answer": "Virtual private network",
      "alternatives": [
        "Encrypted tunnel"
      ],
      "explanation": "VPN: creates encrypted network connection. Purpose: privacy, security enhancement. Usage: public WiFi safety, location spoofing. Protocols: OpenVPN, WireGuard popular. Performance: adds latency typically. Legal: varies by jurisdiction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a firewall?",
      "answer": "Network security filter",
      "alternatives": [
        "Security barrier"
      ],
      "explanation": "Firewall: filters network traffic. Rules: blocks/allows packets. Types: software, hardware. Placement: perimeter typically. Policies: inbound/outbound control. Importance: first defense against threats. Configuration: balance security/usability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a proxy server?",
      "answer": "Intermediary network node",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network relay"
      ],
      "explanation": "Proxy: forwards client requests. Purpose: caching, filtering, anonymity. Types: HTTP, SOCKS. Benefits: performance, security, access control. Transparent: works without client configuration. Reverse: typically server-side."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Network Address Translation?",
      "answer": "NAT",
      "alternatives": [
        "IP address translation"
      ],
      "explanation": "NAT: translates internal to external IPs. Purpose: device hiding, IP conservation. Process: router maintains translation table. Benefits: security through obscurity. IPv6: reduces NAT necessity. Challenges: certain applications problematic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is packet loss?",
      "answer": "Lost data in transmission",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network failure"
      ],
      "explanation": "Packet loss: data packets not reaching destination. Causes: congestion, interference, equipment failure. Impact: quality degradation, retransmission. Measurement: percentage of packets. Acceptable: <1% typical. Solutions: error correction, rerouting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is latency?",
      "answer": "Time delay in transmission",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network delay"
      ],
      "explanation": "Latency: round-trip time for data. Measured: milliseconds (ms). Factors: distance, congestion, hardware. Impact: gaming, VoIP experience. Acceptable: <100ms typical. Improvement: faster connections, closer servers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is peering?",
      "answer": "Direct network interconnection",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network agreement"
      ],
      "explanation": "Peering: ISPs exchange traffic directly. Purpose: reduce costs, improve performance. Types: paid, settlement-free. Benefits: redundancy, lower latency. Importance: backbone of internet infrastructure. Disputes: occasionally arise."
