    {
      "question": "What does CPU stand for?",
      "answer": "Central Processing Unit",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, the primary component that executes instructions and processes data in a computer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does ALU stand for?",
      "answer": "Arithmetic Logic Unit",
      "alternatives": ["Arithmetic and Logic Unit"],
      "explanation": "The ALU is the component within the CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the component that directs CPU operations?",
      "answer": "Control Unit",
      "alternatives": ["CU"],
      "explanation": "The Control Unit manages and coordinates all operations within the CPU by controlling the flow of data and instructions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What unit measures CPU clock speed?",
      "answer": "Hertz",
      "alternatives": ["Hz", "Gigahertz", "GHz", "Megahertz", "MHz"],
      "explanation": "Clock speed is measured in Hertz, with modern CPUs typically rated in gigahertz indicating billions of cycles per second."
    },
    {
      "question": "What register stores the address of the next instruction?",
      "answer": "Program Counter",
      "alternatives": ["PC"],
      "explanation": "The Program Counter keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the high-speed storage locations within the CPU called?",
      "answer": "Registers",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU used for temporary data storage during processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What architecture uses separate buses for data and instructions?",
      "answer": "Harvard architecture",
      "alternatives": ["Harvard"],
      "explanation": "Harvard architecture features separate memory and buses for instructions and data, allowing simultaneous access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the basic operational process of a CPU called?",
      "answer": "Fetch-decode-execute cycle",
      "alternatives": ["Fetch-execute cycle", "Instruction cycle", "Machine cycle"],
      "explanation": "The fetch-decode-execute cycle is the continuous process of retrieving, interpreting, and carrying out instructions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What component performs calculations in the CPU?",
      "answer": "Arithmetic Logic Unit",
      "alternatives": ["ALU"],
      "explanation": "The ALU performs all arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, as well as logical operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What register holds the current instruction being executed?",
      "answer": "Instruction Register",
      "alternatives": ["IR"],
      "explanation": "The Instruction Register temporarily stores the instruction currently being decoded and executed by the CPU."
