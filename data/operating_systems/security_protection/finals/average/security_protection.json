    {
      "question": "What security model uses subject-object-action triples?",
      "answer": "Access control triple",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Access control triples specify who can perform what actions on which objects. They formalize permissions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hierarchical levels enforce military security?",
      "answer": "Security clearances",
      "alternatives": ["Classification levels"],
      "explanation": "Security clearances like Top Secret and Confidential control information access. They implement mandatory access control."
    },
    {
      "question": "What model prevents information flow to lower levels?",
      "answer": "Bell-LaPadula model",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Bell-LaPadula enforces no read up and no write down. It ensures confidentiality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What model prevents information flow to higher levels?",
      "answer": "Biba model",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Biba prevents corruption by enforcing no write up and no read down. It ensures integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack exploits implementation errors to execute code?",
      "answer": "Buffer overflow",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Buffer overflows write beyond allocated memory. They can hijack control flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique randomizes memory addresses?",
      "answer": "ASLR",
      "alternatives": ["Address Space Layout Randomization"],
      "explanation": "ASLR randomizes program memory locations. It makes exploitation harder."
    },
    {
      "question": "What prevents execution of data as code?",
      "answer": "DEP",
      "alternatives": ["Data Execution Prevention", "NX bit"],
      "explanation": "DEP marks memory regions as non-executable. It blocks code injection attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What malware hides its presence?",
      "answer": "Rootkit",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Rootkits conceal malicious activity from detection. They often operate at kernel level."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack deceives users into revealing credentials?",
      "answer": "Phishing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Phishing impersonates trusted entities to steal information. It exploits human psychology."
    },
    {
      "question": "What one-way function secures passwords?",
      "answer": "Hash function",
      "alternatives": ["Cryptographic hash"],
      "explanation": "Hash functions produce fixed-size digests from passwords. They're irreversible for security."
