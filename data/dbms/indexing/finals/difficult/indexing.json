    {
      "question": "A spatial data structure for indexing multi-dimensional information.",
      "answer": "R-tree",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "R-trees are tree data structures used for indexing spatial information like geographic coordinates."
    },
    {
      "question": "An index structure optimized for range queries and sorted data.",
      "answer": "B+ tree",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "B+ trees keep all data in leaf nodes linked together, making range scans efficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "The database component that decides whether to use an index for a query.",
      "answer": "Query optimizer",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The query optimizer analyzes execution plans and decides if using an index is beneficial."
    },
    {
      "question": "An index that stores only part of a column's value.",
      "answer": "Partial index",
      "alternatives": ["Filtered index"],
      "explanation": "Partial indexes include only rows satisfying a predicate, reducing index size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Index type where data is sorted in reverse order.",
      "answer": "Descending index",
      "alternatives": ["Reverse index"],
      "explanation": "Descending indexes store keys in descending order for queries with ORDER BY DESC."
    },
    {
      "question": "A technique that stores precomputed aggregate values for faster queries.",
      "answer": "Bitmap index",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Bitmap indexes use bitmaps for each distinct value, efficient for low-cardinality columns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Process of rebuilding an index to optimize performance and reclaim space.",
      "answer": "Index rebuild",
      "alternatives": ["Reindexing"],
      "explanation": "Index rebuild recreates an index from scratch to eliminate fragmentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Process that updates index statistics without rebuilding the entire index.",
      "answer": "Index reorganization",
      "alternatives": ["Index reorg"],
      "explanation": "Reorganization defragments the leaf level of indexes without rebuilding them."
    },
    {
      "question": "A tree structure where each node can have a variable number of children.",
      "answer": "B-tree",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "B-trees are balanced trees with nodes containing multiple keys and children pointers."
    },
    {
      "question": "An index containing expressions or functions rather than simple columns.",
      "answer": "Function-based index",
      "alternatives": ["Expression index"],
      "explanation": "Function-based indexes store the result of functions or expressions for efficient queries."
