    {
      "question": "What is write endurance?",
      "answer": "Number of write cycles allowed",
      "alternatives": [
        "TBW rating"
      ],
      "explanation": "Write endurance: total data writes possible. Measured: TBW (terabytes written). Typical: 150-600 TBW for consumer SSDs. Importance: consumer SSDs rarely hit limit. Longevity: typically lasts years."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is wear leveling?",
      "answer": "Balancing flash cell writes",
      "alternatives": [
        "SSD longevity technique"
      ],
      "explanation": "Wear leveling: distributes writes across cells. Purpose: extends SSD lifespan. Techniques: dynamic, static. Automatic: firmware handles. Benefit: prevents premature failure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is TRIM?",
      "answer": "Inform SSD of deleted data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Optimization command"
      ],
      "explanation": "TRIM: OS tells SSD about deletions. Purpose: improve SSD performance. Automatic: modern OSes support. Benefit: maintains speed over time. Required: must be enabled."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is overprovisioning?",
      "answer": "Reserve SSD capacity",
      "alternatives": [
        "Unused space allocation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Overprovisioning: extra space reserved. Purpose: wear leveling, performance. Typical: 7-28% reserved. Invisible: users don't see. Benefit: extends lifespan."

    {
      "question": "What is a memory page?",
      "answer": "Fixed-size memory block",
      "alternatives": [
        "Memory unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "Memory page: standard size block. Size: typically 4KB. Purpose: virtual memory, paging. Management: OS handles. Translation: page table used. Concept: basis of VM."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is virtual memory?",
      "answer": "Using storage as RAM",
      "alternatives": [
        "Paging system"
      ],
      "explanation": "Virtual memory: extends RAM with storage. Speed: much slower than RAM. Purpose: run large programs. Management: OS automatic. Swapping: data moves to disk. Overhead: reduces performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is memory bandwidth?",
      "answer": "Data transfer rate from memory",
      "alternatives": [
        "GB/s throughput"
      ],
      "explanation": "Memory bandwidth: speed of data movement. Measured: GB/s typically. Importance: performance impact. Factors: bus width, speed. Saturation: can become bottleneck."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is IOPS?",
      "answer": "Input/output operations per second",
      "alternatives": [
        "Performance metric"
      ],
      "explanation": "IOPS: random access speed measure. Used: storage performance metric. Typical: SSDs 50,000-100,000 IOPS. Typical: HDDs 100-200 IOPS. Database: workload depends on."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is latency?",
      "answer": "Time to access data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Access delay"
      ],
      "explanation": "Latency: delay to retrieve data. Measured: milliseconds (HDD), microseconds (SSD). Importance: affects responsiveness. Factors: seek time, rotation. SSD: much lower than HDD."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a hybrid drive?",
      "answer": "SSD + HDD combined",
      "alternatives": [
        "SSHD"
      ],
      "explanation": "Hybrid drive: combines both technologies. Speed: faster than pure HDD. Capacity: large like HDD. Cost: moderate between both. Performance: depends on usage patterns. Decline: becoming obsolete."
