      "question": "What is material conditional?",
      "answer": "Standard pq equivalent to pq",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical implication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Material: standard interpretation. Equivalence: pq  pq. Truth: false only when p true, q false. Controversy: captures conditional meaning. Metalanguage: formal definition. Application: all conditional statements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is vacuous truth?",
      "answer": "Implication true when antecedent false",
      "alternatives": [
        "False antecedent truth"
      ],
      "explanation": "Concept: pq true when p false. Counterintuitive: 'If unicorns exist then 2+2=5' vacuously true. Rationale: p false makes pq true. Logic: defined this way. Implications: affects reasoning."

    {
      "question": "What is affirming the antecedent?",
      "answer": "Modus ponens (valid inference)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Valid form"
      ],
      "explanation": "Form: pq, p; therefore q. Validity: sound argument. Examples: multiple contexts. Importance: basic reasoning form. Contrast: invalid forms exist (affirming consequent)."

        "Valid form"
      ],
      "explanation": "Form: pq, q; therefore p. Validity: sound argument. Examples: contrapositive reasoning. Importance: basic reasoning form. Application: elimination reasoning."

      "question": "What is affirming the consequent (fallacy)?",
      "answer": "Invalid: pq, q; therefore p",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical fallacy"
      ],
      "explanation": "Invalid: conclusion doesn't follow. Form: pq, q; therefore p. Problem: q true doesn't imply p true. Example: 'If rains then wet; wet; therefore rains' (false - could be sprinkler). Importance: identify as fallacy."

      "question": "What is denying the antecedent (fallacy)?",
      "answer": "Invalid: pq, p; therefore q",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical fallacy"
      ],
      "explanation": "Invalid: conclusion doesn't follow. Form: pq, p; therefore q. Problem: p false doesn't imply q false. Example: 'If rains then wet; not rains; therefore not wet' (false - sprinkler). Importance: identify as fallacy."

      "alternatives": [
        "Transitive implication"

      "explanation": "Form: pq, qr; therefore pr. Validity: sound principle. Chain: multiple implications. Examples: long chains. Application: logical sequences. Importance: reasoning foundation."

      "answer": "Example disproving statement",
      "alternatives": [
        "Disproof example"
      ],
      "explanation": "Method: show premise true but conclusion false. Purpose: prove statement false. Example: converse false counterexample suffices. Power: one case disproofs. Importance: disproof method."

      "question": "What is biconditional statement?",
      "answer": "pq (if and only if)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Iff statement"
      ],
      "explanation": "Biconditional: both directions true. Meaning: pq AND qp. Truth: both true or both false. Equivalence: p and q must have same value. Example: 'Triangle iff 3 sides'. Application: definitions."

      "question": "What is conditional probability?",
      "answer": "Probability given assumption",
      "alternatives": [
        "Conditional probability"
      ],
      "explanation": "Probability: p(q|p) given p. Related: conditional statements in logic. Distinction: probability vs certainty. Example: P(wet|rain) vs logical implication. Connection: related concepts."
