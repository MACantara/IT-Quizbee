      "question": "What verifies user identity?",
      "options": [
        "Authorization",
        "Authentication",
        "Accounting",
        "Auditing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Authentication confirms user identity through credentials. Common methods include passwords, biometrics, and tokens."
    },

      "question": "What determines access permissions?",
      "options": [
        "Authentication",
        "Authorization",
        "Encryption",
        "Hashing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Authorization specifies what authenticated users can access. It enforces access control policies."
    },

      "question": "What transforms data to prevent unauthorized reading?",
      "options": [
        "Hashing",
        "Compression",
        "Encryption",
        "Encoding"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Encryption converts plaintext to ciphertext using keys. Only authorized parties can decrypt it."

    {
      "question": "What security principle grants minimum necessary permissions?",
      "options": [
        "Defense in depth",
        "Least privilege",
        "Separation of duties",
        "Need to know"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Least privilege limits access to only what's required. It minimizes potential damage from compromised accounts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What matrix shows subjects and object permissions?",
      "options": [
        "Permission table",
        "Access control matrix",
        "Rights database",
        "Security policy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Access control matrices map subjects to objects with their permissions. They're fundamental to access control."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attack repeatedly tries password combinations?",
      "options": [
        "Phishing",
        "Brute force",
        "SQL injection",
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Brute force attacks systematically try all possible passwords. They're countered with strong passwords and rate limiting."

      "question": "What malicious code replicates across systems?",
      "options": [
        "Trojan",
        "Virus",
        "Worm",
        "Rootkit"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Worms self-replicate across networks without user action. They can spread rapidly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What list specifies user permissions per object?",
      "options": [
        "Capability list",
        "Access control list",
        "Permission set",
        "Rights table"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Access Control Lists associate objects with authorized users and permissions. They're common in file systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What unforgeable token represents access rights?",
      "options": [
        "Password",
        "Capability",
        "ACL",
        "Certificate"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Capabilities are unforgeable tokens granting specific access rights. Possession authorizes access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What restricts process execution scope?",
      "options": [
        "Protection ring",
        "Protection domain",
        "Security level",
        "Access mode"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Protection domains define accessible resources for processes. They enforce isolation between processes."
