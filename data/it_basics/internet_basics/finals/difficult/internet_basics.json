      "question": "What is BGP?",
      "answer": "Border Gateway Protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Routing protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "BGP: routes traffic between autonomous systems. Purpose: connects ISPs worldwide. Updates: distributed dynamically. Redundancy: multiple paths available. Security: vulnerable to hijacking. Standard: RFC 4271 defines. Complexity: autonomous system management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is SDN?",
      "answer": "Software-Defined Networking",
      "alternatives": [
        "Programmable networks"
      ],
      "explanation": "SDN: separates control from data planes. Benefits: flexibility, programmability, cost reduction. Architecture: controllers manage switches. Implementation: OpenFlow protocol. Adoption: cloud providers embracing. Future: network evolution direction."

      "question": "What is anycast?",
      "answer": "Nearest node routing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Destination-based routing"
      ],
      "explanation": "Anycast: packets routed to nearest instance. Uses: DNS, CDN services. Advantage: reduced latency. Implementation: multiple servers, same address. Challenges: connection consistency. Standards: IPv6 native support."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is MPLS?",
      "answer": "Multiprotocol Label Switching",
      "alternatives": [
        "Label-based routing"
      ],
      "explanation": "MPLS: routes packets using labels. Benefits: fast switching, traffic engineering. Layer: between network and transport. Uses: ISP backbones. Performance: reduced forwarding complexity. Standards: RFC 3031 defines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is network slicing?",
      "answer": "Logical network partitioning",
      "alternatives": [
        "Virtual network separation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Network slicing: creates virtual networks. Purpose: service differentiation, isolation. Uses: 5G networks, enterprise. Benefits: resource optimization, security. Implementation: SDN/NFV technologies. Future: essential for 5G/6G."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is zero-trust security?",
      "answer": "No implicit trust model",
      "alternatives": [
        "Verification-based security"
      ],
      "explanation": "Zero-trust: verify every access request. Assumption: breach already occurred. Implementation: microsegmentation, monitoring. Benefits: modern security approach. Challenges: implementation complexity. Adoption: increasing in enterprises."
