      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Batch processing systems group similar jobs together and execute them sequentially without user interaction. Jobs are collected and processed in batches to improve efficiency.",

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Time-sharing systems allow multiple users to access the system concurrently by rapidly switching the CPU between users. Each user gets a time slice, creating the illusion of dedicated access.",

        "To run multiple operating systems simultaneously"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Distributed operating systems coordinate multiple independent computers connected by a network, making them appear as a single coherent system to users. Resources are shared across the network transparently.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What distinguishes a network operating system from a distributed operating system?",
      "options": [
        "Network OS requires manual resource access, distributed OS provides transparency",
        "Network OS is faster than distributed OS",
        "Network OS supports more users",
        "Network OS requires less hardware"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In a network OS, users are aware of networked resources and must explicitly access them. In a distributed OS, the system provides transparency, making multiple computers appear as one unified system.",
      "id": "ope_sys_os_typ_elim_005"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which OS type is optimized for handling multiple concurrent requests from clients?",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Server operating systems are optimized to handle multiple concurrent client requests efficiently. They emphasize stability, security, and resource management for services like web hosting and databases.",

        "Support for supercomputing tasks",
        "Unlimited memory capacity"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Power management and battery efficiency are critical in mobile OS because mobile devices run on limited battery power. The OS must balance performance with energy consumption to extend battery life.",

        "One processor controls all others",
        "All processors share equal access to memory and I/O",
        "Each processor has dedicated memory",
        "Processors work on different operating systems"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Symmetric multiprocessing means all processors share equal access to memory and I/O devices. Any processor can run any task, and the OS distributes work evenly across all processors.",
