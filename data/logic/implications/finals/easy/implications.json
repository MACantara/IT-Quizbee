      "question": "What is an implication?",
      "answer": "If-then statement (pq)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Conditional"
      ],
      "explanation": "Implication: logical if-then. Form: 'if p then q'. Antecedent: p (condition). Consequent: q (result). Truth: false only when p true, q false. Logic: fundamental reasoning form. Examples: all conditional statements."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is implication false?",
      "answer": "When antecedent true and consequent false",
      "alternatives": [
        "Falsity condition"
      ],
      "explanation": "False case: p true, q false (TF). All other cases: true. Examples: 'If rains then wet' false when rains but not wet. Verification: truth table shows. Importance: defining condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the antecedent?",
      "answer": "Hypothesis (condition part)",
      "alternatives": [
        "If part"
      ],
      "explanation": "Antecedent: p in pq. Role: condition/hypothesis. Position: before arrow. Importance: determines consequence. False antecedent: implication always true (vacuously)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the consequent?",
      "answer": "Conclusion (result part)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Then part"
      ],
      "explanation": "Consequent: q in pq. Role: conclusion/result. Position: after arrow. Importance: what follows from condition. True consequent: implication always true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the converse?",
      "answer": "Reversing implication (qp)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Reverse direction"
      ],
      "explanation": "Converse: opposite direction. Original: pq. Converse: qp. Different: not logically equivalent. Example: 'If wet then rains' (false sometimes). Importance: different meaning. Warning: don't confuse."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the inverse?",
      "answer": "Negating both parts (pq)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Negation of both"
      ],
      "explanation": "Inverse: negate antecedent and consequent. Original: pq. Inverse: pq. Different: not equivalent to original. Example: 'If not rains then not wet'. Relationship: inverse and converse equivalent to each other."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the contrapositive?",
      "answer": "Negate and reverse (qp)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Reverse negation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Contrapositive: negate and reverse both parts. Original: pq. Contrapositive: qp. Equivalent: logically identical. Example: 'If not wet then not rains'. Usage: sometimes easier to prove. Importance: always equivalent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is transitivity?",
      "answer": "If pq and qr then pr",
      "alternatives": [
        "Chain reasoning"
      ],
      "explanation": "Transitivity: chaining implications. From two implications: pq and qr. Conclusion: pr. Validity: sound principle. Example: 'If study then pass, if pass then graduate'. Application: logical chains."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is modus ponens?",
      "answer": "From pq and p, conclude q",
      "alternatives": [
        "Affirming antecedent"
      ],
      "explanation": "Rule: if pq true and p true, then q true. Validity: sound inference. Use: deductive reasoning. Example: 'If rains then wet; it rains; therefore wet'. Importance: fundamental reasoning rule."

      "question": "What is modus tollens?",
      "answer": "From pq and q, conclude p",
      "alternatives": [

      "explanation": "Rule: if pq true and q false, then p false. Validity: sound inference. Use: deductive reasoning. Example: 'If rains then wet; not wet; therefore not rains'. Importance: fundamental reasoning rule."
