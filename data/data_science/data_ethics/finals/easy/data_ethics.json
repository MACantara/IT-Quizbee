    {
      "question": "What principle ensures individuals control their personal data?",
      "answer": "Privacy",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data privacy"
      ],
      "explanation": "Privacy protects individuals' personal information from unauthorized access and use. Includes concepts of consent, anonymity, and confidentiality. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA enforce privacy rights. Organizations must implement security measures and transparent data practices. Privacy builds trust and is fundamental right in digital age."
    },
    {
      "question": "What systematic error makes AI models unfair?",
      "answer": "Bias",
      "alternatives": [
        "Algorithmic bias"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bias in AI refers to systematic errors making predictions unfairly favor or discriminate against groups. Sources include biased training data, feature selection, or algorithm design. Can amplify existing societal biases. Affects decisions in hiring, lending, criminal justice. Mitigation requires diverse data, fairness metrics, and regular auditing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What principle ensures AI systems treat all groups equally?",
      "answer": "Fairness",
      "alternatives": [
        "Algorithmic fairness"
      ],
      "explanation": "Fairness ensures AI systems don't discriminate against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics (race, gender, age). Multiple definitions exist: demographic parity, equalized odds, individual fairness. Trade-offs between fairness metrics. Requires defining fairness for specific context, measuring disparate impact, and implementing mitigation strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What regulation protects EU citizens' data?",
      "answer": "GDPR",
      "alternatives": [
        "General Data Protection Regulation"
      ],
      "explanation": "GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is EU law protecting personal data and privacy. Key rights: access, rectification, erasure ('right to be forgotten'), portability. Requires explicit consent, data protection by design, breach notification. Applies to organizations processing EU residents' data regardless of location. Heavy fines for non-compliance. Influenced global data regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process involves explaining AI decisions to humans?",
      "answer": "Explainability",
      "alternatives": [
        "Interpretability"
      ],
      "explanation": "Explainability refers to making AI decisions understandable to humans. Important for trust, debugging, compliance, and fairness. Techniques include LIME, SHAP, attention visualization, decision trees. Trade-off between model performance (complex models) and interpretability (simple models). Critical for high-stakes decisions (healthcare, finance, justice). Regulations increasingly require explainability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What term describes using data ethically and responsibly?",
      "answer": "Data governance",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data stewardship"
      ],
      "explanation": "Data governance establishes policies and procedures for managing data as strategic asset. Ensures quality, security, privacy, compliance. Defines roles (data owners, stewards, custodians), standards, and processes. Includes data lifecycle management, access control, audit trails. Prevents data becoming liability. Essential for ethical data use and regulatory compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process gets permission before collecting data?",
      "answer": "Consent",
      "alternatives": [
        "Informed consent"
      ],
      "explanation": "Consent is permission from individuals to collect, use, and share their personal data. Should be informed (understanding purpose), specific (not blanket), freely given (not coerced), and revocable. GDPR requires explicit consent for sensitive data. Consent fatigue is challenge. Ethical data practices prioritize meaningful consent over checkbox compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What practice removes identifying information from data?",
      "answer": "Anonymization",
      "alternatives": [
        "De-identification"
      ],
      "explanation": "Anonymization removes or modifies personally identifiable information so individuals cannot be identified. Techniques include removing direct identifiers, aggregation, generalization, noise addition, pseudonymization. Challenge: re-identification attacks combining multiple datasets. K-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy provide formal guarantees. Critical for privacy-preserving data sharing and research."
    },
    {
      "question": "What obligation requires organizations to justify data use?",
      "answer": "Accountability",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data accountability"
      ],
      "explanation": "Accountability means organizations are responsible for data practices and must demonstrate compliance. Includes documenting decisions, conducting audits, appointing data protection officers. Organizations must be able to justify data collection and use. GDPR emphasizes accountability principle. Requires culture of privacy and ethics beyond legal compliance. Essential for building trust."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ethical concern involves AI making important decisions?",
      "answer": "Algorithmic decision-making",
      "alternatives": [
        "Automated decision-making"
      ],
      "explanation": "Algorithmic decision-making uses AI to make or significantly influence important decisions affecting individuals. Concerns include bias, lack of transparency, accountability gaps, and removing human judgment. GDPR grants right to human review of automated decisions. Requires careful consideration of when AI should decide versus assist humans. High-stakes domains need special scrutiny."
