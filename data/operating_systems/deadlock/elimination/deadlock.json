    {
      "question": "What occurs when processes wait indefinitely for resources?",
      "options": [
        "Starvation",
        "Deadlock",
        "Livelock",
        "Race condition"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Deadlock is a state where processes wait indefinitely for resources held by other waiting processes. No progress occurs without intervention."
    },
    {
      "question": "What deadlock condition means resources can't be forcibly taken?",
      "options": [
        "Mutual exclusion",
        "Hold and wait",
        "No preemption",
        "Circular wait"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "No preemption means resources can't be forcibly removed from processes. Processes must voluntarily release resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "What graph visualizes resource allocation and requests?",
      "options": [
        "Process tree",
        "Resource allocation graph",
        "Dependency graph",
        "State diagram"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Resource allocation graphs show processes, resources, and their relationships. Cycles indicate potential deadlock."
    },
    {
      "question": "What algorithm checks if resource allocation is safe?",
      "options": [
        "Dijkstra's algorithm",
        "Banker's algorithm",
        "Round robin",
        "Priority scheduling"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Banker's algorithm determines if granting a request leaves the system in a safe state. It's used for deadlock avoidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition means processes hold some resources while requesting more?",
      "options": [
        "Mutual exclusion",
        "Hold and wait",
        "No preemption",
        "Circular wait"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hold and wait means processes retain allocated resources while waiting for additional ones. This enables deadlock formation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What approach prevents deadlock by denying one necessary condition?",
      "options": [
        "Deadlock prevention",
        "Deadlock avoidance",
        "Deadlock detection",
        "Deadlock recovery"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Deadlock prevention eliminates at least one of the four necessary conditions. This guarantees deadlock cannot occur."
    },
    {
      "question": "What system state allows all processes to complete?",
      "options": [
        "Unsafe state",
        "Safe state",
        "Ready state",
        "Blocked state"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A safe state has at least one execution sequence where all processes can finish. Deadlock is impossible in safe states."
    },
    {
      "question": "What recovery method terminates processes to break deadlock?",
      "options": [
        "Process preemption",
        "Process abortion",
        "Rollback",
        "Checkpoint"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Process abortion terminates deadlocked processes to reclaim resources. It can kill one process or all deadlocked processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition requires exclusive resource access?",
      "options": [
        "Mutual exclusion",
        "Hold and wait",
        "No preemption",
        "Circular wait"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Mutual exclusion means only one process can use a resource at a time. It's necessary for correctness but enables deadlock."
    },
    {
      "question": "What forms a chain of processes each waiting for the next?",
      "options": [
        "Process queue",
        "Circular wait",
        "Priority chain",
        "Dependency list"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Circular wait means processes form a cycle where each waits for a resource held by the next. It's a necessary deadlock condition."
