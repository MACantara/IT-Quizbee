    {
      "question": "What semantic tag represents article content?",
      "answer": "Article",
      "alternatives": [
        "<article>"
      ],
      "explanation": "<article> semantic tag represents independent content (blog post, news story, comment). Improves: accessibility (screen readers), SEO (structure). Vs. <div>: <article> has semantic meaning. Can nest <article> within <article>. Used: news sites, blogs, forums. Helps organize content logically."
    },
    {
      "question": "What semantic tag defines page sections?",
      "answer": "Section",
      "alternatives": [
        "<section>"
      ],
      "explanation": "<section> semantic tag groups thematically related content. Represents document section (chapters, tabs, etc.). Improves accessibility, SEO. Use when content naturally groups. Vs. <div>: <section> semantic. Too many <section>s harm readability. Use judiciously for meaningful sections."
    },
    {
      "question": "What semantic tag identifies main content?",
      "answer": "Main",
      "alternatives": [
        "<main>"
      ],
      "explanation": "<main> semantic tag contains primary page content (excludes header, footer, navigation). One <main> per page. Helps screen readers skip to content. Improves accessibility, SEO. Assistive tech: identifies main focus. Use instead of generic <div> for content area."
    },
    {
      "question": "What semantic tag labels navigation?",
      "answer": "Nav",
      "alternatives": [
        "<nav>"
      ],
      "explanation": "<nav> semantic tag defines navigation section. Contains links: main navigation, breadcrumbs, pagination. Not all links need <nav> (e.g., footer links). Improves: accessibility (skip to nav), SEO (crawling). Screen readers: identify navigation purpose."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tag creates table structure?",
      "answer": "Table",
      "alternatives": [
        "<table>"
      ],
      "explanation": "<table> creates data table. Structure: <tr> (row), <td> (data cell), <th> (header cell). <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot> organize sections. Semantic: indicates data relationship. Use: tabular data (not layout - use CSS Grid/Flexbox). Accessibility: scope attributes link headers to cells."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attribute validates email input?",
      "answer": "type=\"email\"",
      "alternatives": [
        "Email type",
        "Email input"
      ],
      "explanation": "type=\"email\" on <input> validates email format. Browser checks: @ symbol, domain. Shows email keyboard on mobile. Provides user feedback for invalid format. Client-side validation (prevent unnecessary submissions). Server-side validation still needed for security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attribute makes input required?",
      "answer": "required",
      "alternatives": [
        "Required attribute"
      ],
      "explanation": "required attribute makes form field mandatory. Browser prevents form submission if empty. Shows validation message. Client-side validation (UX improvement). Server-side validation essential for security (never trust client). Improves form usability, error prevention."
    },
    {
      "question": "What attribute provides input hints?",
      "answer": "placeholder",
      "alternatives": [
        "Placeholder attribute"
      ],
      "explanation": "placeholder attribute displays hint text in input field. Disappears on focus. Improves UX: shows expected format (e.g., \"mm/dd/yyyy\"). Not replacement for label (accessibility). Assistive tech: ignores placeholder. Use with explicit <label> tags."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tag associates label with input?",
      "answer": "Label",
      "alternatives": [
        "<label>"
      ],
      "explanation": "<label> associates text with form input. Attribute for=\"id\" matches input id. Improves: accessibility (screen readers), usability (larger click area for checkbox/radio). Clicks label: focuses/activates input. Essential for accessible forms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tag groups related form elements?",
      "answer": "Fieldset",
      "alternatives": [
        "<fieldset>"
      ],
      "explanation": "<fieldset> groups related form inputs. <legend> labels group. Visually: border around grouped inputs. Improves: accessibility (logical grouping), organization. Example: personal info, payment info sections. Semantic structure for complex forms."
