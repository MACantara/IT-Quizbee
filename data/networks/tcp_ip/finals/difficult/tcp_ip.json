    {
      "question": "What is the combination of an IP address and port number called?",
      "answer": "socket",
      "alternatives": ["network socket", "socket address"],
      "explanation": "A socket uniquely identifies an endpoint in network communication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What TCP flag indicates the final packet in a connection termination?",
      "answer": "FIN",
      "alternatives": ["finish", "fin flag"],
      "explanation": "The FIN flag signals that a sender has finished sending data and wants to close the connection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What TCP header field controls congestion management?",
      "answer": "window size",
      "alternatives": ["receive window", "tcp window"],
      "explanation": "The window size field implements flow control by specifying buffer capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the maximum size of data in a single TCP segment called?",
      "answer": "MSS",
      "alternatives": ["Maximum Segment Size"],
      "explanation": "MSS defines the largest amount of data that can be sent in a single TCP segment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the maximum transmission unit for a network called?",
      "answer": "MTU",
      "alternatives": ["Maximum Transmission Unit"],
      "explanation": "MTU is the largest packet size that can be transmitted over a network."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process breaks packets into smaller units for transmission?",
      "answer": "fragmentation",
      "alternatives": ["packet fragmentation", "IP fragmentation"],
      "explanation": "Fragmentation divides packets that exceed the MTU into smaller fragments."
    },
    {
      "question": "What TCP mechanism retransmits lost packets?",
      "answer": "error recovery",
      "alternatives": ["retransmission", "automatic repeat request", "ARQ"],
      "explanation": "TCP detects lost packets and automatically retransmits them for reliability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What field in the IP header indicates the protocol used in the data portion?",
      "answer": "protocol number",
      "alternatives": ["protocol field", "protocol identifier"],
      "explanation": "The protocol field identifies whether the data is TCP, UDP, ICMP, or another protocol."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique allows multiple applications to share a single IP address?",
      "answer": "port multiplexing",
      "alternatives": ["multiplexing", "port-based multiplexing"],
      "explanation": "Port numbers enable multiple applications to use the same IP address simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "question": "What mechanism prioritizes certain types of network traffic?",
      "answer": "QoS",
      "alternatives": ["Quality of Service", "quality of service"],
      "explanation": "QoS manages network resources to provide different priority levels to different traffic types."
