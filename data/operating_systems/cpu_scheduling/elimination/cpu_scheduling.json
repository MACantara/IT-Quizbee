    {
      "question": "What is CPU scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "The method by which the OS decides which process gets CPU time",
        "Installing a CPU",
        "Overclocking the CPU",
        "Cooling the CPU"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "CPU scheduling is the process by which the operating system decides which ready process should be allocated the CPU for execution. The goal is to maximize CPU utilization and system throughput while minimizing response time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "The newest process runs first",
        "Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue",
        "The shortest process runs first",
        "Processes with highest priority run first"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive. It's simple but can suffer from the convoy effect where short processes wait behind long ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "The longest process runs first",
        "Processes run randomly",
        "The process with the smallest execution time runs first",
        "The oldest process runs first"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "SJF is a scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest burst time to execute next. It's optimal for minimizing average waiting time but requires knowing future CPU burst times, which is often impractical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Round Robin (RR) scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "Running processes in priority order",
        "Running the shortest job first",
        "Running processes alphabetically",
        "Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum) in a circular queue"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum), typically 10-100ms. After the quantum expires, the process is preempted and added to the end of the ready queue."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Priority Scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "Processes are assigned priorities and higher priority processes execute first",
        "All processes have equal priority",
        "Random selection of processes",
        "Newest processes run first"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Priority Scheduling assigns a priority to each process, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority. Can be preemptive or non-preemptive. May suffer from starvation where low-priority processes never execute."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "No difference",
        "Preemptive can interrupt a running process; non-preemptive cannot",
        "Non-preemptive is faster",
        "Preemptive uses more memory"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Preemptive scheduling allows the OS to forcibly remove a process from the CPU and allocate it to another process. Non-preemptive scheduling lets a process run until it voluntarily releases the CPU (finishes or waits for I/O)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is starvation in CPU scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "When the CPU overheats",
        "When processes run too quickly",
        "When a low-priority process waits indefinitely because higher-priority processes keep arriving",
        "When there's no memory available"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Starvation occurs when a process is perpetually denied necessary resources, typically in priority scheduling where low-priority processes never get CPU time. Aging (gradually increasing priority) can prevent starvation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the convoy effect?",
      "options": [
        "Multiple CPUs working together",
        "Fast context switching",
        "Efficient scheduling",
        "When short processes wait for a long process in FCFS, reducing CPU utilization"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The convoy effect occurs in FCFS scheduling when several short processes are queued behind one long process, causing poor average waiting time and reduced CPU and device utilization. It's like being stuck behind a slow truck on a one-lane road."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Multilevel Queue Scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "Multiple ready queues with different priorities and scheduling algorithms",
        "A single queue with multiple entries",
        "Scheduling based on memory usage",
        "Random scheduling"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Multilevel Queue Scheduling divides the ready queue into several separate queues, each with its own scheduling algorithm. Processes are permanently assigned to a queue based on properties like process type or priority (e.g., foreground vs. background)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is turnaround time in CPU scheduling?",
      "options": [
        "Time taken to switch processes",
        "Total time from process submission to completion",
        "Time spent waiting in queue",
        "Time spent executing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Turnaround time is the total time from when a process is submitted until it completes. It includes waiting time in the ready queue, execution time on the CPU, and I/O time. Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time."
