    {
      "question": "What is the base of the binary number system?",
      "answer": "2",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The binary number system has a base of 2, using only two digits: 0 and 1. It's the fundamental number system used in computing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the decimal equivalent of binary 1010?",
      "answer": "10",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Binary 1010 equals decimal 10. Calculation: (1×2³) + (0×2²) + (1×2¹) + (0×2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which number system uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F?",
      "answer": "Hexadecimal",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Hexadecimal (base 16) uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F, where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, and F=15."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the hexadecimal equivalent of decimal 15?",
      "answer": "F",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Decimal 15 equals F in hexadecimal. In hex, A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, and F=15."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the octal number system's base?",
      "answer": "8",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The octal number system has a base of 8, using digits 0 through 7. It's sometimes used in computing for representing binary data more compactly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many bits are in 1 byte?",
      "answer": "8",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "1 byte consists of 8 bits. A bit is the smallest unit of data (0 or 1), and a byte can represent 256 different values (2⁸)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the binary equivalent of decimal 5?",
      "answer": "101",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Decimal 5 equals binary 101. Calculation: 5 = (1×2²) + (0×2¹) + (1×2⁰) = 4 + 0 + 1 = 101₂."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which prefix represents hexadecimal numbers in programming?",
      "answer": "0x",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The prefix 0x (or 0X) is commonly used to denote hexadecimal numbers in programming. For example, 0xFF represents decimal 255."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a nibble in computing?",
      "answer": "4 bits (half a byte)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A nibble is 4 bits, which is half of a byte. It can represent 16 different values (0-15) and corresponds to one hexadecimal digit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is hexadecimal commonly used in computing?",
      "answer": "It provides a compact way to represent binary data",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Hexadecimal is commonly used because it provides a compact, human-readable way to represent binary data. Each hex digit represents exactly 4 binary bits."
