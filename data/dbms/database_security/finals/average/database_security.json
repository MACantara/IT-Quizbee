    {
      "question": "Technique using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.",
      "answer": "Prepared statements",
      "alternatives": ["Parameterized queries"],
      "explanation": "Prepared statements separate SQL code from data, preventing injection attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Named collections of privileges that can be assigned to users.",
      "answer": "Roles",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Roles group related privileges together for easier permission management."
    },
    {
      "question": "Security control that limits access based on sensitivity labels.",
      "answer": "Mandatory Access Control",
      "alternatives": ["MAC"],
      "explanation": "MAC uses classification levels to enforce security policies independently of data owners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Security control where data owners determine access permissions.",
      "answer": "Discretionary Access Control",
      "alternatives": ["DAC"],
      "explanation": "DAC allows data owners to grant or restrict access to their resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "Encryption method using the same key for encryption and decryption.",
      "answer": "Symmetric encryption",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encrypting and decrypting data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Encryption method using different keys for encryption and decryption.",
      "answer": "Asymmetric encryption",
      "alternatives": ["Public-key encryption"],
      "explanation": "Asymmetric encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption."
    },
    {
      "question": "Security vulnerability where users access data outside their authorized scope.",
      "answer": "Privilege escalation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Privilege escalation occurs when users gain unauthorized elevated access rights."
    },
    {
      "question": "The process of transforming passwords into fixed-length strings for storage.",
      "answer": "Hashing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Hashing creates one-way digests of passwords, making them difficult to reverse."
    },
    {
      "question": "Random data added to passwords before hashing to enhance security.",
      "answer": "Salt",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Salt makes identical passwords produce different hashes, preventing rainbow table attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Security feature requiring multiple forms of verification.",
      "answer": "Multi-factor authentication",
      "alternatives": ["MFA", "Two-factor authentication"],
      "explanation": "MFA combines multiple authentication methods like passwords, tokens, and biometrics."
