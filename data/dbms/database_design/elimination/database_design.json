      "question": "What is an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram used for?",
      "options": [
        "To store data",
        "To model database structure visually",
        "To execute queries",
        "To backup databases"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "ER diagrams visually represent entities, attributes, and relationships in a database design."

        "Attribute",
        "Cardinality"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "An entity represents a distinct object or concept, such as a person, place, or thing."

        "Entity",
        "Relationship",
        "Attribute",
        "Primary key"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Attributes are properties or characteristics that describe an entity."

        "Attributes",
        "Keys",
        "Relationships",
        "Tables"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Relationships show how entities are connected or associated with each other."

      "question": "What is a one-to-many relationship?",
      "options": [
        "One entity relates to exactly one other entity",

        "Many entities relate to many entities",
        "No entities are related"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In a one-to-many relationship, one instance of an entity relates to multiple instances of another."

      "question": "What is a many-to-many relationship?",
      "options": [
        "One entity relates to one entity",

        "Many entities relate to many entities",
        "No relationship exists"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Many-to-many relationships allow multiple instances of each entity to be related to multiple instances of the other."

      "question": "What table is needed to implement a many-to-many relationship?",
      "options": [
        "Parent table",
        "Child table",
        "Junction table",
        "Reference table"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A junction table (or bridge table) contains foreign keys from both entities to implement many-to-many relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "What describes how many instances of one entity relate to another?",
      "options": [
        "Normalization",
        "Cardinality",
        "Referential integrity",
        "Denormalization"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cardinality specifies the numerical relationship between entity instances, like one-to-one or one-to-many."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a weak entity?",
      "options": [
        "An entity with no attributes",
        "An entity that depends on another entity for identification",
        "An entity with many relationships",
        "An entity without relationships"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A weak entity cannot be uniquely identified without a relationship to another (strong) entity."
