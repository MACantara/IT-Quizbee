      "question": "What does it mean for two statements to be logically equivalent?",
      "options": [
        "They have the same truth value in all possible cases",
        "They use the same words",
        "They have the same number of operators",
        "They look similar"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in all possible cases. This is denoted by p ≡ q or p ⇔ q."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The implication p → q is logically equivalent to ¬p ∨ q. This can be verified using truth tables or logical laws."

        "¬(p → q) ≡ p ∧ ¬q"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "De Morgan's first law states that ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q. The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p, and they are logically equivalent. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true."

      "explanation": "The converse (q → p) is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication (p → q). They can have different truth values."

        "¬¬p ≡ p",
        "¬¬p ≡ true"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The double negation law states that ¬¬p ≡ p. Negating a proposition twice returns you to the original proposition."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The biconditional p ↔ q is logically equivalent to (p → q) ∧ (q → p). It means both implications must hold true."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you prove two statements are logically equivalent?",
      "options": [
        "Show their truth tables are identical",
        "Use the same words",
        "Count the operators",
        "Check if they look similar"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Two statements are logically equivalent if their truth tables produce identical results for all possible input combinations. You can also use logical laws to transform one into the other."

        "∨"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Logical equivalence is denoted by ≡ or ⇔. When we write p ≡ q, it means p and q have the same truth value in all cases."
