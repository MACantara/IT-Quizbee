      "options": [
        "50%",

        "68%",
        "95%"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of data falls within one standard deviation of the mean."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A t-test compares the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically different."

        "Variance",
        "Range",
        "Covariance",
        "Mean deviation"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Variance is the average of squared deviations from the mean and equals the square of standard deviation."
