    {
      "question": "What advanced data structure enables hierarchical relationships with parent-child nodes?",
      "answer": "Tree structure",
      "alternatives": [
        "Hierarchical data structure"
      ],
      "explanation": "Tree structures organize data hierarchically with nodes connected by edges. Each node (except the root) has one parent and zero or more children. Trees are used for file systems, organizational charts, XML/JSON documents, and decision trees. Common types include binary trees, B-trees, and tries."
    },
    {
      "question": "What data storage format uses key-value pairs in nested structures?",
      "answer": "JSON",
      "alternatives": [
        "JavaScript Object Notation"
      ],
      "explanation": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, human-readable format for structured data using key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. It's language-independent and widely used for APIs, configuration files, and data interchange. JSON's simplicity and flexibility make it preferred over XML for many applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique represents high-dimensional data in lower dimensions while preserving structure?",
      "answer": "Dimensionality reduction",
      "alternatives": [
        "Feature reduction"
      ],
      "explanation": "Dimensionality reduction transforms high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while retaining important information. Techniques include PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE, and autoencoders. This addresses the curse of dimensionality, enables visualization of complex data, and improves machine learning performance by removing redundant features."
    },
    {
      "question": "What data quality issue occurs when the same entity has multiple different representations?",
      "answer": "Data inconsistency",
      "alternatives": [
        "Conflicting data"
      ],
      "explanation": "Data inconsistency arises when the same information is represented differently across records or systems. Examples include 'NY' vs 'New York', different date formats, or conflicting values for the same entity. Inconsistency hampers analysis and integration. Resolution requires standardization, deduplication, and data governance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What sampling technique divides population into groups and samples all members of selected groups?",
      "answer": "Cluster sampling",
      "alternatives": [
        "Area sampling"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cluster sampling divides the population into clusters (groups) and randomly selects entire clusters for study. All members of selected clusters are included. This is cost-effective for geographically dispersed populations but may introduce bias if clusters aren't representative. It differs from stratified sampling, which samples within each stratum."
    },
    {
      "question": "What bias occurs when sample systematically differs from the population?",
      "answer": "Selection bias",
      "alternatives": [
        "Sampling bias"
      ],
      "explanation": "Selection bias occurs when sample selection isn't random, causing systematic differences between the sample and population. This leads to non-representative samples and invalid inferences. Examples include volunteer bias, survivorship bias, and non-response bias. Random sampling and careful study design help minimize selection bias."
    },
    {
      "question": "What graph structure consists of nodes connected by edges without hierarchy?",
      "answer": "Network graph",
      "alternatives": [
        "Graph data structure"
      ],
      "explanation": "Network graphs represent relationships as nodes (vertices) connected by edges (links). Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles and multiple connections. They model social networks, transportation systems, and web pages. Graph databases and algorithms analyze connectivity, shortest paths, centrality, and communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What data quality dimension measures whether data values are within acceptable ranges?",
      "answer": "Data validity",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data conformity"
      ],
      "explanation": "Data validity ensures values conform to defined formats, types, and business rules. Valid data falls within acceptable ranges, follows format constraints (e.g., email format), and satisfies domain rules. Validation rules prevent invalid data entry and can be enforced at collection, storage, or analysis stages."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique assigns numerical values to categorical variables for machine learning?",
      "answer": "Encoding",
      "alternatives": [
        "Feature encoding",
        "Categorical encoding"
      ],
      "explanation": "Encoding converts categorical variables to numerical format for machine learning algorithms. Techniques include label encoding (assigning integers), one-hot encoding (binary columns for each category), and target encoding (based on target variable statistics). The choice depends on whether categories have inherent order and the algorithm being used."
    },
    {
      "question": "What statistical measure indicates how much variance in one variable is explained by another?",
      "answer": "R-squared",
      "alternatives": [
        "Coefficient of determination"
      ],
      "explanation": "R-squared (R²) measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from independent variables. Values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction. In regression, R² of 0.80 means 80% of variance is explained by the model. However, high R² doesn't guarantee causation or model appropriateness."
