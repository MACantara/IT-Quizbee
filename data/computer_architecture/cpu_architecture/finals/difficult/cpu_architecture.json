    {
      "question": "What CPU design philosophy uses complex instructions that can execute several operations?",
      "answer": "CISC",
      "alternatives": ["Complex Instruction Set Computer", "Complex Instruction Set Computing"],
      "explanation": "CISC processors use complex instructions that can perform multiple operations per instruction, reducing program size but increasing complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the technique called where CPU executes instructions out of their original program order?",
      "answer": "Out-of-order execution",
      "alternatives": ["OoO execution", "Dynamic execution"],
      "explanation": "Out-of-order execution allows the CPU to execute instructions as resources become available, improving performance by avoiding idle time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What predicts whether a conditional branch will be taken to improve pipeline efficiency?",
      "answer": "Branch predictor",
      "alternatives": ["Branch prediction", "Branch prediction unit"],
      "explanation": "Branch predictors use algorithms to guess the outcome of conditional branches, reducing pipeline stalls and improving performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What allows a single CPU core to execute multiple threads simultaneously?",
      "answer": "Simultaneous multithreading",
      "alternatives": ["SMT", "Hyper-threading", "Hyperthreading"],
      "explanation": "SMT enables a single physical core to appear as multiple logical processors, improving resource utilization and throughput."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the unit that renames registers to eliminate false dependencies?",
      "answer": "Register renaming unit",
      "alternatives": ["Register renaming", "Rename unit"],
      "explanation": "Register renaming eliminates write-after-write and write-after-read hazards by mapping architectural registers to physical registers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What executes instructions without waiting for preceding instructions to complete?",
      "answer": "Superscalar execution",
      "alternatives": ["Superscalar architecture", "Superscalar processing"],
      "explanation": "Superscalar processors can execute multiple instructions in parallel using multiple execution units within a single core."
    },
    {
      "question": "What buffer stores decoded micro-operations in modern x86 processors?",
      "answer": "Micro-op cache",
      "alternatives": ["Î¼op cache", "uop cache", "Decoded instruction cache"],
      "explanation": "The micro-op cache stores decoded instructions to avoid repeated decoding, improving efficiency in modern processors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the technique of executing the same instruction on multiple data points simultaneously?",
      "answer": "SIMD",
      "alternatives": ["Single Instruction Multiple Data", "Vector processing"],
      "explanation": "SIMD allows one instruction to operate on multiple data elements in parallel, commonly used in multimedia and scientific computing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What determines the number of instructions fetched per cycle in superscalar processors?",
      "answer": "Issue width",
      "alternatives": ["Fetch width", "Decode width"],
      "explanation": "Issue width determines how many instructions can be dispatched to execution units simultaneously in a superscalar processor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the reorder buffer used for in out-of-order processors?",
      "answer": "Maintain program order for completion",
      "alternatives": ["Ensure in-order retirement", "Track instruction completion"],
      "explanation": "The reorder buffer ensures instructions complete in program order despite out-of-order execution, maintaining correct program semantics."
