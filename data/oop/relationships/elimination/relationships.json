      "question": "What is an 'IS-A' relationship?",
      "options": [
        "A relationship implemented through inheritance",
        "A relationship through composition",
        "A relationship through aggregation",
        "A simple association"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "An IS-A relationship is implemented through inheritance, where a subclass 'is a' type of its superclass. For example, Dog IS-A Animal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a 'HAS-A' relationship?",
      "options": [
        "A relationship implemented through composition or aggregation",
        "A relationship through inheritance",
        "An interface implementation",
        "A polymorphic relationship"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A HAS-A relationship is implemented through composition or aggregation, where one object contains or has another object. For example, Car HAS-A Engine."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is association?",
      "options": [
        "A relationship where objects are independent but can interact",
        "A parent-child relationship",
        "An inheritance relationship",
        "A dependency injection"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Association is a relationship between two independent objects where they can interact with each other but have their own lifecycles. Example: Teacher and Student."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is composition?",
      "options": [
        "A strong ownership where contained objects cannot exist without the container",
        "A weak relationship",
        "An inheritance relationship",
        "A simple reference"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Composition is a strong HAS-A relationship where the contained object's lifecycle is tied to the container. If the container is destroyed, contained objects are also destroyed. Example: House and Room."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is aggregation?",
      "options": [
        "A weak ownership where contained objects can exist independently",
        "A strong ownership relationship",
        "An inheritance relationship",
        "A polymorphic relationship"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Aggregation is a weak HAS-A relationship where contained objects can exist independently of the container. Example: Department and Professor - professors can exist without the department."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is dependency?",
      "options": [
        "A relationship where one class uses another class temporarily",
        "A permanent relationship",
        "An inheritance relationship",
        "A composition relationship"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Dependency is a weak relationship where one class temporarily uses another class, typically as a method parameter or local variable, without owning it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is multiplicity in object relationships?",
      "options": [
        "The number of instances involved in a relationship",
        "The number of methods in a class",
        "The number of attributes",
        "The inheritance depth"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Multiplicity (or cardinality) defines how many instances of one class relate to instances of another class. Examples: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does bidirectional association mean?",
      "options": [
        "Both classes have references to each other",
        "Only one class has a reference",
        "No references exist",
        "Inheritance is used"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Bidirectional association means both classes have references to each other, allowing navigation in both directions. Example: Order knows its Customer, and Customer knows their Orders."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a unidirectional association?",
      "options": [
        "Only one class has a reference to the other",
        "Both classes reference each other",
        "No references exist",
        "Uses inheritance"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Unidirectional association means only one class has a reference to the other class, allowing navigation in only one direction. Example: Student knows their Address, but Address doesn't know the Student."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between composition and aggregation?",
      "options": [
        "Composition implies ownership and lifecycle dependency; aggregation does not",
        "No difference exists",
        "Composition is for inheritance",
        "Aggregation is stronger"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Composition represents a strong ownership where the contained object cannot exist without the container (lifecycle dependency). Aggregation is a weaker relationship where objects can exist independently."
