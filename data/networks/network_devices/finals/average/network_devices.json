    {
      "question": "At which OSI layer does a hub operate?",
      "answer": "Physical layer",
      "alternatives": ["layer 1", "physical"],
      "explanation": "Hubs operate at the Physical layer, simply repeating electrical signals."
    },
    {
      "question": "At which OSI layer does a switch operate?",
      "answer": "Data Link layer",
      "alternatives": ["layer 2", "data link"],
      "explanation": "Switches operate at the Data Link layer using MAC addresses for forwarding."
    },
    {
      "question": "At which OSI layer does a router operate?",
      "answer": "Network layer",
      "alternatives": ["layer 3", "network"],
      "explanation": "Routers operate at the Network layer using IP addresses for routing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of addressing does a switch use?",
      "answer": "MAC addresses",
      "alternatives": ["MAC", "physical addresses", "hardware addresses"],
      "explanation": "Switches use MAC addresses to identify and forward frames to specific devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of addressing does a router use?",
      "answer": "IP addresses",
      "alternatives": ["IP", "logical addresses"],
      "explanation": "Routers use IP addresses to route packets between different networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What table does a switch use to forward frames?",
      "answer": "MAC address table",
      "alternatives": ["CAM table", "switching table", "forwarding table"],
      "explanation": "The MAC address table maps MAC addresses to switch ports for frame forwarding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What table does a router use to determine packet paths?",
      "answer": "routing table",
      "alternatives": ["route table", "forwarding table"],
      "explanation": "The routing table contains network paths and determines the best route for packets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of collision domain does a hub create?",
      "answer": "single collision domain",
      "alternatives": ["one collision domain", "shared collision domain"],
      "explanation": "All devices connected to a hub share a single collision domain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of collision domain does a switch create per port?",
      "answer": "separate collision domain",
      "alternatives": ["individual collision domain", "dedicated collision domain", "per-port collision domain"],
      "explanation": "Each switch port has its own collision domain, reducing collisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process do switches use to learn MAC addresses?",
      "answer": "MAC address learning",
      "alternatives": ["address learning", "learning process", "dynamic learning"],
      "explanation": "Switches learn MAC addresses by examining source addresses in incoming frames."
