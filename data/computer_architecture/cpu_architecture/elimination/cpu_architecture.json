        "Volts"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Clock speed is measured in Hertz, typically GHz (gigahertz) for modern CPUs, indicating how many cycles the CPU can execute per second."

        "Connect to peripheral devices"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU that temporarily hold data, addresses, and instructions during processing."

        "Cache Performance Improvement",
        "Cycles Per Instruction"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) measures the average number of clock cycles required to execute a single instruction."

        "RISC architecture",
        "CISC architecture"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Von Neumann architecture uses a single shared bus for both instructions and data, which can create a bottleneck known as the Von Neumann bottleneck."

    {
      "question": "What advantage does Harvard architecture have over Von Neumann?",
      "options": [
        "Lower cost",
