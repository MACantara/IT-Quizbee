    {
      "question": "What development approach writes tests before writing the actual code?",
      "answer": "Test-Driven Development",
      "alternatives": [
        "TDD"
      ],
      "explanation": "TDD follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle: write a failing test, write code to pass it, then refactor the code while keeping tests passing.",

    {
      "question": "What testing approach writes tests based on examples in natural language?",
      "answer": "Behavior-Driven Development",
      "alternatives": [
        "BDD"
      ],
      "explanation": "BDD uses natural language constructs like Given-When-Then to describe behavior and create tests that are readable by non-technical stakeholders.",

      "answer": "Test Coverage",
      "alternatives": [
        "Code Coverage"
      ],
      "explanation": "Test Coverage quantifies how much of the code is exercised by test cases, often measured as line, branch, or path coverage.",

      "answer": "Equivalence Partitioning",
      "alternatives": [
        "Equivalence Class Testing"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence Partitioning divides input data into valid and invalid partitions where all values in a partition should be treated identically.",

      "answer": "Boundary Value Analysis",
      "alternatives": [
        "BVA"
      ],
      "explanation": "Boundary Value Analysis tests values at the boundaries between partitions, as errors often occur at these edge cases.",

      "question": "What strategy tests each module separately before integration?",
      "answer": "Bottom-up Testing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bottom-up Integration"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bottom-up Testing starts with the lowest level modules and progressively integrates and tests higher level modules using test drivers.",

      "question": "What are the specific conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete?",

      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Acceptance Criteria are predefined requirements that must be met for a user story to be accepted, often written in Given-When-Then format.",
