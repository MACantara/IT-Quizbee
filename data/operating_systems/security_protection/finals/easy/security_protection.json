    {
      "question": "What process verifies user identity?",
      "answer": "Authentication",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Authentication confirms identity through credentials. It answers who you are.",

    {
      "question": "What process determines access permissions?",
      "answer": "Authorization",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Authorization specifies what authenticated users can do. It controls resource access.",
      "id": "sec_pro_sec_pro_e_finals_001"

      "question": "What converts data to unreadable format?",
      "answer": "Encryption",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Encryption transforms plaintext to ciphertext. Only those with keys can decrypt it.",

    {
      "question": "What principle grants minimal necessary access?",
      "answer": "Least privilege",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Least privilege limits permissions to only what's needed. It reduces security risks.",

      "question": "What matrix maps subjects to object permissions?",
      "answer": "Access control matrix",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Access control matrices show who can access what. They're fundamental security structures.",

      "question": "What list specifies user permissions for an object?",
      "answer": "Access control list",
      "alternatives": [
        "ACL"
      ],
      "explanation": "ACLs attach to objects listing authorized users and permissions. They're common in file systems.",

      "question": "What unforgeable token grants access rights?",
      "answer": "Capability",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Capabilities are tokens representing access rights. Possessing one authorizes access.",

    {
      "question": "What defines process access scope?",
      "answer": "Protection domain",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Protection domains specify what resources processes can access. They enforce isolation.",

      "question": "What attack tries all password combinations?",
      "answer": "Brute force attack",
      "alternatives": [
        "Brute force"
      ],
      "explanation": "Brute force attacks systematically try every possible password. They require strong passwords to counter.",
