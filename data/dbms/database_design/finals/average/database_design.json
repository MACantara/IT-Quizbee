    {
      "question": "An attribute that uniquely identifies each entity instance.",
      "answer": "Primary key",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The primary key is the unique identifier for each row in a table."
    },
    {
      "question": "An attribute in one table that references the primary key in another table.",
      "answer": "Foreign key",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Foreign keys establish and enforce relationships between tables."
    },
    {
      "question": "The design phase where the ER model is converted to table structures.",
      "answer": "Logical design",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Logical design translates the conceptual model into a database schema."
    },
    {
      "question": "The design phase that considers specific DBMS features and storage.",
      "answer": "Physical design",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Physical design optimizes the database for a specific DBMS and hardware environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "An entity that can exist independently without depending on another entity.",
      "answer": "Strong entity",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Strong entities have their own primary key and don't depend on other entities for identification."
    },
    {
      "question": "An attribute that can be broken down into smaller sub-attributes.",
      "answer": "Composite attribute",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Composite attributes can be divided, like an address into street, city, and zip code."
    },
    {
      "question": "An attribute that can have multiple values for a single entity instance.",
      "answer": "Multi-valued attribute",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Multi-valued attributes allow multiple values, like a person having multiple phone numbers."
    },
    {
      "question": "An attribute whose value is calculated from other attributes.",
      "answer": "Derived attribute",
      "alternatives": ["Computed attribute"],
      "explanation": "Derived attributes are computed from other data, like age calculated from birth date."
    },
    {
      "question": "Whether participation in a relationship is required for all entity instances.",
      "answer": "Participation constraint",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Participation constraints specify if all entities must participate in a relationship (total) or not (partial)."
    },
    {
      "question": "A high-level data model focusing on concepts rather than implementation.",
      "answer": "Conceptual model",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Conceptual models like ER diagrams represent data requirements independently of DBMS."
