      "question": "What is a truth table?",
      "options": [
        "A table showing all possible truth values of propositions and compound statements",
        "A table of mathematical formulas",
        "A database table",
        "A spreadsheet"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A truth table is a mathematical table that shows all possible combinations of truth values for propositions and the resulting truth values of compound statements formed from them."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many rows are needed in a truth table with 3 propositional variables?",
      "options": [
        "3",
        "8",
        "6",
        "9"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The number of rows in a truth table is 2^n, where n is the number of propositional variables. With 3 variables, we need 2³ = 8 rows."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a truth table for p → q (if p then q), when is the implication false?",
      "options": [
        "When p is false and q is true",
        "When p is false and q is false",
        "When p is true and q is false",
        "When p is true and q is true"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "An implication p → q is false only when the hypothesis (p) is true but the conclusion (q) is false. In all other cases, it is true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can you determine by examining the final column of a truth table?",
      "options": [
        "The number of variables",
        "The syntax of the statement",
        "The operators used",
        "Whether the statement is a tautology, contradiction, or contingency"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The final column shows the truth values of the complete statement for all possible inputs. If all values are T, it's a tautology; if all F, it's a contradiction; otherwise, it's a contingency."
    },
    {
      "question": "When both p and q are false, what is the truth value of p ∨ q?",

        "False",
        "True",
        "Unknown",
        "Undefined"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The disjunction p ∨ q (p OR q) is true when at least one of the propositions is true. When both p and q are false, p ∨ q is false."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a truth table, what does the XOR (exclusive OR) operation produce when both inputs are true?",

        "True",
        "False",
        "Undefined",
        "Both true and false"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "XOR (exclusive OR) is true only when exactly one of the inputs is true. When both inputs are true or both are false, XOR produces false."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you identify logically equivalent statements using truth tables?",
      "options": [
        "By counting the number of rows",
        "By checking the operators used",
        "By comparing their final columns - if identical, they are equivalent",
        "By examining the first row only"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Two statements are logically equivalent if they have identical truth values for all possible combinations of inputs. This is shown by identical final columns in their truth tables."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the truth value of p ↔ q (biconditional) when p and q have the same truth value?",
      "options": [
        "False",
        "Undefined",
        "Depends on context",
        "True"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The biconditional p ↔ q (p if and only if q) is true when both propositions have the same truth value (both true or both false)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When constructing a truth table, in what order should you typically evaluate compound statements?",
      "options": [
        "Follow operator precedence: negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication, biconditional",
        "Left to right always",
        "Right to left always",
        "Random order"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "When constructing truth tables, follow operator precedence: evaluate negations first, then conjunctions, then disjunctions, then implications, and finally biconditionals (unless parentheses override this)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a truth table with all 'True' values in the final column indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A contradiction",
        "A tautology",
        "An invalid statement",
        "A contingency"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "When the final column of a truth table contains all 'True' values, the statement is a tautology - a statement that is always true regardless of the truth values of its components."
