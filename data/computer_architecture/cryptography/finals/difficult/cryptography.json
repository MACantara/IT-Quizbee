    {
      "question": "What is the encryption mode that turns a block cipher into a stream cipher?",
      "answer": "CTR",
      "alternatives": [
        "Counter mode",
        "CTR mode"
      ],
      "explanation": "Counter mode encrypts a counter value for each block and XORs it with plaintext, creating a stream cipher from a block cipher."

      "question": "What cryptographic primitive provides authenticated encryption with associated data?",
      "answer": "AEAD",
      "alternatives": [
        "Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data",
        "GCM",
        "Galois/Counter Mode"
      ],
      "explanation": "AEAD schemes like AES-GCM provide both confidentiality and authenticity, protecting data and verifying it hasn't been tampered with."

      "question": "What is the elliptic curve cryptography equivalent security level of RSA-3072?",
      "answer": "256-bit ECC",

        "ECC-256",
        "256-bit elliptic curve",
        "ECDSA-256"
      ],
      "explanation": "A 256-bit ECC key provides equivalent security to a 3072-bit RSA key with much smaller key sizes."

      "question": "What key exchange protocol allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel?",
      "answer": "Diffie-Hellman",
      "alternatives": [
        "DH",
        "Diffie-Hellman key exchange",
        "ECDH"
      ],
      "explanation": "Diffie-Hellman enables secure key exchange without prior shared secrets, based on the discrete logarithm problem."

      "alternatives": [
        "Cryptanalytic attack",
        "Mathematical attack"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cryptanalysis uses mathematical techniques to break ciphers more efficiently than trying all possible keys."

    {
      "question": "What property ensures a hash function cannot produce the same output for different inputs?",
      "answer": "Collision resistance",
      "alternatives": [
        "Collision-resistant",
        "Collision-free property"
      ],
      "explanation": "Collision resistance makes it computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output."

      "answer": "OAEP",
      "alternatives": [
        "Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding",
        "RSA-OAEP"
      ],
      "explanation": "OAEP adds randomness to RSA encryption, preventing chosen-plaintext attacks and making the encryption non-deterministic."

      "question": "What type of cipher encrypts data one bit or byte at a time?",
      "answer": "Stream cipher",
      "alternatives": [
        "Stream encryption",
        "Streaming cipher"
      ],
      "explanation": "Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext continuously, one bit or byte at a time, using a keystream."
