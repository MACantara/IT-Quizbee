    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a version control system?",
      "answer": "To track and manage changes to files over time",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Version control systems (VCS) track and manage changes to files over time, allowing developers to recall specific versions, collaborate effectively, maintain history, and revert to previous states when needed. This is essential for team collaboration and code management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between centralized and distributed version control systems?",
      "answer": "In centralized VCS, there's one central repository; in distributed VCS, each developer has a complete repository copy",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Centralized VCS (like SVN) has a single central repository that all developers connect to, while distributed VCS (like Git) gives each developer a complete copy of the repository with full history. Distributed systems enable offline work and more flexible workflows."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Git, what command is used to create a new branch?",
      "answer": "git branch branch-name",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The command 'git branch branch-name' creates a new branch. To create and switch to the new branch in one command, you can use 'git checkout -b branch-name' or 'git switch -c branch-name' (in newer Git versions)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'git commit' do?",
      "answer": "Records staged changes to the local repository with a message",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The 'git commit' command records all staged changes to the local repository along with a descriptive message. It creates a snapshot of the current state of staged files. Changes are not uploaded to remote repositories until 'git push' is executed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a merge conflict in Git?",
      "answer": "When Git cannot automatically reconcile differences between two branches",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile differences between two branches being merged, typically when the same lines of code have been modified differently in both branches. Developers must manually resolve these conflicts by choosing which changes to keep."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of 'git pull' command?",
      "answer": "To fetch and merge changes from remote repository to local branch",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The 'git pull' command fetches changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into the current local branch. It's essentially a combination of 'git fetch' (which retrieves changes) and 'git merge' (which integrates them)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a pull request (PR) or merge request in Git workflows?",
      "answer": "A request to review and merge code changes from one branch into another",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab) is a mechanism for requesting that code changes from one branch be reviewed and merged into another branch. It facilitates code review, discussion, and quality control before changes are integrated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which Git branching strategy maintains separate branches for development, staging, and production?",
      "answer": "Git Flow",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Git Flow is a branching model that uses multiple long-lived branches including 'develop' for ongoing development, 'main/master' for production, and temporary branches for features, releases, and hotfixes. It provides a structured approach to managing releases and parallel development."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the '.gitignore' file do?",
      "answer": "Specifies intentionally untracked files and patterns that Git should ignore",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The '.gitignore' file specifies patterns for files and directories that Git should ignore and not track. This is useful for excluding build artifacts, dependencies, configuration files, and other files that shouldn't be version controlled."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of 'git rebase'?",
      "answer": "To reapply commits on top of another base branch, creating a linear history",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Git rebase reapplies commits from one branch on top of another branch's tip, creating a linear commit history. Unlike merge, which creates a merge commit, rebase rewrites history by moving commits, resulting in a cleaner, more linear project history. However, it should be used carefully with shared branches."
