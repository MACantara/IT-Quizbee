      "question": "What is a payment gateway?",
      "answer": "A service that authorizes and processes online payment transactions between merchants and customers",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A payment gateway is a technology service that securely authorizes and processes online payment transactions between merchants (websites/apps) and customers, acting as a 'middleman' between the merchant's website, banks, and payment networks. How it works: (1) Customer enters payment info on checkout, (2) Gateway encrypts data and sends to payment processor, (3) Processor communicates with customer's bank (issuing bank), (4) Bank approves/declines transaction, (5) Response sent back through processor to gateway, (6) Gateway updates merchant and customer, (7) Funds transferred (settlement). Key functions: (1) Encryption: secures sensitive payment data (SSL/TLS), (2) Authorization: verifies funds availability, (3) Fraud detection: identifies suspicious transactions, (4) Multi-currency support, (5) Multiple payment methods (cards, wallets, bank transfers). Popular gateways: Stripe, PayPal, Square, Authorize.Net, Braintree, Adyen. Fees: transaction fees (2-3% + fixed fee per transaction), monthly fees, setup fees. Essential for e-commerce - enables secure online payments."

      "question": "What is PCI DSS compliance?",
      "answer": "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards ensuring companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment, protecting cardholder data from breaches and fraud. Established by: PCI Security Standards Council (founded by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB). 12 requirements grouped in 6 goals: (1) Build and maintain secure network (firewalls, secure configurations), (2) Protect cardholder data (encryption at rest and in transit, mask display), (3) Maintain vulnerability management (antivirus, secure systems), (4) Implement access control (restrict access, unique IDs, physical access), (5) Monitor and test networks (track access, test security), (6) Maintain information security policy (document and communicate policies). Compliance levels: based on transaction volume (Level 1: 6M+ annually requires annual audit). Non-compliance consequences: fines ($5,000-$100,000/month), increased fees, losing ability to accept cards, legal liability for breaches. How to achieve: use payment gateways/tokenization (Stripe, PayPal) to avoid storing card data directly, regular security audits, employee training. Essential for any business handling card payments."

      "question": "What is tokenization in payment processing?",
      "answer": "Replacing sensitive card data with unique identification symbols (tokens) that retain essential information without compromising security",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Tokenization replaces sensitive payment data (card numbers, CVV) with unique identification symbols called tokens that have no exploitable value, protecting customer data during transactions and storage. How it works: (1) Customer enters card information, (2) Payment gateway sends data to token vault (secure server), (3) Vault generates random token (e.g., '4532-XXXX-XXXX-1234' becomes 'TKN_a7f2b9c4'), (4) Token returned and stored by merchant, (5) Original data securely stored in vault, (6) For future transactions, token sent instead of actual card data, (7) Vault de-tokenizes for payment processing. Benefits: (1) Security: tokens useless if stolen (no reverse engineering), (2) PCI DSS compliance: reduces scope (not storing actual card data), (3) Reduced breach risk, (4) Enable features: one-click checkout, subscriptions, saved payment methods. Types: (1) Network tokens: created by card networks (Visa, Mastercard), (2) Gateway tokens: created by payment processors. Similar concept: encryption (transforms data reversibly vs. tokenization maps randomly). Used by: all major payment processors (Stripe, PayPal, Square). Essential security measure for modern e-commerce."

      "question": "What is a chargeback?",
      "answer": "A forced reversal of a card transaction initiated by the cardholder's bank, often due to disputes or fraud",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A chargeback is a reversal of a credit card transaction initiated by the cardholder through their issuing bank, returning funds to the customer and debiting the merchant, designed to protect consumers from fraud and billing errors. Common reasons: (1) Fraud: unauthorized transaction, stolen card, (2) Product issues: not received, not as described, defective, (3) Processing errors: duplicate charges, incorrect amount, (4) Customer disputes: dissatisfaction, canceled subscription not stopped, (5) Friendly fraud: customer disputes legitimate charge (intentional or forgetful). Chargeback process: (1) Customer disputes transaction with bank, (2) Bank investigates and initiates chargeback, (3) Funds taken from merchant account, (4) Merchant receives notification and can dispute (provide evidence), (5) Bank/card network makes final decision, (6) Winner receives funds. Impact on merchants: (1) Lost revenue (product + payment), (2) Chargeback fees ($15-$100 per chargeback), (3) High ratio = penalties, increased processing fees, account termination, (4) Damage to merchant reputation. Prevention: clear descriptions, excellent customer service, transparent policies, delivery confirmation, fraud detection, clear billing descriptors, prompt refunds. Difference from refunds: chargebacks involve bank/forced vs. merchant-initiated refunds."

      "question": "What is 3D Secure authentication?",
      "answer": "An additional security layer requiring cardholders to verify identity during online transactions (Verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "3D Secure (3DS) is an additional authentication layer for online credit/debit card transactions, requiring cardholders to verify their identity with the issuing bank before completing purchase, reducing fraud and chargebacks. Three domains: (1) Acquirer (merchant's bank), (2) Issuer (cardholder's bank), (3) Interoperability (card scheme infrastructure). Brand names: Verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode, American Express SafeKey, Discover ProtectBuy. How it works: (1) Customer enters card details, (2) 3DS check initiated, (3) Redirect to bank's authentication page, (4) Customer verifies identity (password, SMS code, biometric), (5) Bank authenticates and approves/denies, (6) Transaction completed or rejected. Versions: (1) 3DS 1.0: static passwords, separate authentication page, poor UX, (2) 3DS 2.0 (launched 2018): improved UX, risk-based authentication (frictionless for low-risk), biometrics, mobile-optimized, more data shared for decision-making. Benefits: (1) Fraud reduction: verifies cardholder identity, (2) Liability shift: fraud liability transfers from merchant to issuing bank (if 3DS used), (3) Lower chargebacks, (4) Required: SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) mandatory in Europe. Drawbacks: potential cart abandonment (extra step), implementation complexity. Modern adoption increasing due to regulations."

      "question": "What is recurring billing?",
      "answer": "Automatic charging of customers at regular intervals for subscriptions or services",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Recurring billing (subscription billing) automatically charges customers at regular intervals (weekly, monthly, annually) for ongoing products or services, common for SaaS, memberships, streaming, subscriptions. How it works: (1) Customer subscribes and provides payment method, (2) Initial charge processed, (3) Payment information securely stored (tokenized), (4) Automatic charges at scheduled intervals, (5) Customer receives receipts, (6) Subscription continues until canceled. Types: (1) Fixed recurring: same amount each period (Netflix, Spotify), (2) Variable recurring: amount changes based on usage (utilities, cloud services), (3) Metered billing: pay per usage unit. Benefits for merchants: (1) Predictable revenue (MRR - Monthly Recurring Revenue), (2) Improved cash flow, (3) Customer retention, (4) Reduced administrative costs, (5) Easier forecasting. Benefits for customers: (1) Convenience (no manual payment), (2) Uninterrupted service, (3) Budget planning. Challenges: (1) Failed payments (expired cards, insufficient funds) - requires dunning management, (2) Churn, (3) Cancellation management. Best practices: clear terms, easy cancellation, reminder emails before charging, retry failed payments, offer payment method updates. Tools: Stripe Billing, PayPal Subscriptions, Recurly, Chargebee. Essential for modern subscription businesses."

      "question": "What is fraud detection in payment systems?",
      "answer": "Using automated tools and rules to identify and prevent fraudulent payment transactions in real-time",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Fraud detection in payment systems uses automated tools, algorithms, and rules to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, protecting merchants from financial losses and chargebacks. Common fraud types: (1) Card-not-present (CNP) fraud: stolen card info used online, (2) Account takeover: hijacked customer accounts, (3) Friendly fraud: legitimate customer falsely disputes charge, (4) Card testing: criminals test stolen cards with small charges, (5) Triangulation fraud: fake storefronts collect card data. Detection methods: (1) Rule-based: predefined rules (velocity checks, amount thresholds, mismatched billing/shipping), (2) Machine learning: analyzes patterns, learns from historical data, adapts to new fraud types (Stripe Radar, Signifyd), (3) Device fingerprinting: tracks device characteristics, detects suspicious devices, (4) Geolocation: flags mismatched IP/billing locations, (5) 3D Secure: authentication layer, (6) Velocity checks: multiple transactions in short time. Risk scoring: assigns score (0-100) to each transaction, merchant sets threshold for approval/review/decline. Response: decline suspicious transactions, request additional verification, manual review. Balance: minimize fraud without blocking legitimate customers (false positives hurt sales). Tools: Stripe Radar, PayPal Fraud Protection, Kount, Riskified. Essential for e-commerce profitability and sustainability."
