    {
      "question": "Memory type that loses data when power is removed.",
      "answer": "Volatile memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Volatile memory like RAM requires continuous power to maintain stored data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Memory type that retains data even without power.",
      "answer": "Non-volatile memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Non-volatile memory like ROM, SSDs, and HDDs keep data permanently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Fast memory built into the CPU chip.",
      "answer": "L1 cache",
      "alternatives": ["Level 1 cache"],
      "explanation": "L1 cache is the fastest and smallest cache directly on the processor."
    },
    {
      "question": "The standard interface used to connect SSDs and HDDs to motherboards.",
      "answer": "SATA",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SATA is the Serial ATA interface for connecting storage devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Storage interface faster than SATA, often used for modern SSDs.",
      "answer": "NVMe",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "NVMe uses PCIe lanes for significantly faster data transfer than SATA."
    },
    {
      "question": "A group of 8 bits.",
      "answer": "Byte",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A byte consists of 8 bits and is the basic unit for measuring storage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Type of RAM that must be constantly refreshed to maintain data.",
      "answer": "DRAM",
      "alternatives": ["Dynamic RAM"],
      "explanation": "DRAM stores data in capacitors that need periodic refreshing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Type of RAM that is faster and doesn't need refreshing.",
      "answer": "SRAM",
      "alternatives": ["Static RAM"],
      "explanation": "SRAM uses flip-flops to store data and is faster but more expensive than DRAM."
    },
    {
      "question": "Storage technology that writes data once but can be read many times.",
      "answer": "CD-R",
      "alternatives": ["DVD-R"],
      "explanation": "CD-R and DVD-R are write-once, read-many optical storage media."
    },
    {
      "question": "Storage that can be erased and rewritten multiple times.",
      "answer": "Flash memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Flash memory in SSDs and USB drives can be written and erased repeatedly."
