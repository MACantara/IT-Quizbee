      "question": "What provides electrical stability?",
      "answer": "Voltage regulator module",
      "alternatives": [
        "VRM"
      ],
      "explanation": "VRM: stabilizes CPU voltage. Phases: multi-phase for precision. Quality: affects stability, overclocking headroom. Efficiency: reduces heat. Ripple: noise minimization. Design: motherboard critical component. Failure: system instability, crashes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What handles thermal management?",
      "answer": "Thermal sensors and throttling",
      "alternatives": [
        "Temperature control"
      ],
      "explanation": "Sensors: monitor temperatures. Throttling: reduce speed if overheating. Benefits: protection, longevity. Limitations: performance impact. Algorithms: balance thermal and performance. Importance: system reliability. Tuning: control behavior."

      "question": "What bridges memory and I/O?",
      "answer": "Memory controller",
      "alternatives": [
        "Integrated controller"
      ],
      "explanation": "Memory controller: manages RAM access. Location: typically on CPU (modern). Timing: coordinates reads/writes. Performance: latency impacts. Refresh: DRAM maintenance. ECC: error correction (if supported). Speed: matches CPU/motherboard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What distributes power efficiently?",
      "answer": "Power delivery network",
      "alternatives": [
        "PDN"
      ],

    {
      "question": "What protects against surges?",
      "answer": "Surge protector",
      "alternatives": [
        "Spike suppressor"
      ],
      "explanation": "Surge protector: limits voltage spikes. Importance: hardware protection. MOV: metal oxide varistor absorbs surge. Response: nanoseconds. Failure: sacrifices itself. Replacement: necessary after surge. UPS: uninterruptible power supply alternative."

      "question": "What enables expandability?",
      "answer": "PCIe slots",
      "alternatives": [
        "Expansion slots"
      ],
      "explanation": "PCIe: PCI Express standard. Versions: PCIe 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 (increasing bandwidth). Lanes: determine speed. Hot-swap: remove/add without reboot. Backward compatible: older cards work. Power: dedicated pins on slot. Importance: future upgrades possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What optimizes memory bandwidth?",
      "answer": "Memory interface",
      "alternatives": [
        "Memory bus"
      ],
      "explanation": "Interface: connects CPU to RAM. Bits: 64-bit, 128-bit, or more. Frequency: MHz or GHz. Bandwidth: bits per second. Latency: affects performance. Modern: very high speeds (DDR5 6000+ MHz). Importance: performance critical factor."
