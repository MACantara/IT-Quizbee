    {
      "question": "What is logical implication?",
      "answer": "pq (if p then q)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Conditional relationship"
      ],
      "explanation": "Implication: antecedent implies consequent. Truth: false when p true, q false. Contrapositive: qp (equivalent). Converse: qp (not equivalent). Inverse: pq (not equivalent). Importance: reasoning foundation. Application: all conditional statements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a tautology?",
      "answer": "Always true proposition",
      "alternatives": [
        "Universal truth"
      ],
      "explanation": "Tautology: true regardless of variable values. Example: pp (law of excluded middle). Proof: truth table all true. Importance: logical laws are tautologies. Used: prove other formulas. Contradiction: opposite (always false)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a contradiction?",
      "answer": "Always false proposition",
      "alternatives": [
        "Impossible statement"
      ],
      "explanation": "Contradiction: never true (all false). Example: pp (law of non-contradiction). Proof: truth table all false. Avoided: in logic systems. Detection: formal analysis reveals. Unreliable: systems with contradictions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are De Morgan's Laws?",
      "answer": "(pq)(pq) and (pq)(pq)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Negation rules"
      ],
      "explanation": "De Morgan: distribution of negation. First: negate AND becomes OR of negations. Second: negate OR becomes AND of negations. Useful: simplify complex negations. Proof: truth table verification. Application: circuit design, Boolean algebra."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a contingency?",
      "answer": "Proposition sometimes true, sometimes false",
      "alternatives": [
        "Contingent formula"
      ],
      "explanation": "Contingency: truth depends on values. Not tautology: not always true. Not contradiction: not always false. Example: pq (depends on p, q). Most formulas: contingent. Analysis: determine nature of formula."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the logical laws?",
      "answer": "Rules preserving truth relationships",
      "alternatives": [
        "Logical equivalences"
      ],
      "explanation": "Laws: commutative, associative, distributive, absorption, identity. Commutative: pq  qp. Associative: (pq)r  p(qr). Identity: pT  p. Dominance: pT  T. Application: simplify formulas, optimize circuits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the law of excluded middle?",
      "answer": "pp is always true",
      "alternatives": [
        "Tertium non datur"
      ],
      "explanation": "Excluded middle: either p or not p. Guarantee: no middle ground. Tautology: pp always true. Foundation: classical logic. Intuition: controversial in constructive logic. Consequence: complete certainty possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the law of non-contradiction?",
      "answer": "pp is always false",
      "alternatives": [
        "Contradiction prohibition"
      ],
      "explanation": "Non-contradiction: not both p and not p. Guarantee: no contradiction. Contradiction: pp always false. Foundation: logical consistency. Assumption: all logical systems make. Violation: inconsistent systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What simplifies complex formulas?",
      "answer": "Logical equivalence laws",
      "alternatives": [
        "Simplification rules"
      ],
      "explanation": "Simplification: replace complex with simpler. Laws: identity, dominance, idempotence, absorption. Absorption: p(pq)  p. Goal: normal form achievement. Applications: circuit minimization, algorithm optimization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the contrapositive?",
      "answer": "qp (equivalent to pq)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Reverse negation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Contrapositive: logically equivalent to original. Original: pq. Contrapositive: qp. Use: sometimes easier to prove. Proof: assume negation of conclusion. Logic: always equivalent. Different: from converse (not equivalent)."
