      "alternatives": [
        "Tautology"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: p or not p always true. Foundation: classical logic. Implication: complete coverage. Proof: truth table shows. Application: proof by cases. Controversy: intuitionistic logic rejects. Importance: classical reasoning base."

      "answer": "(pp)  T",
      "alternatives": [
        "Contradiction law"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: can't have p and not p. Foundation: logical consistency. Implication: mutual exclusivity. Proof: truth table shows. Application: consistency check. Importance: essential principle. Aristotle: foundational law."

      "answer": "pq  pq",
      "alternatives": [
        "Implication law"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: implication converts to negation or consequent. Equivalence: both formulas same. Proof: truth table shows. Application: eliminate conditionals. Importance: transformation rule. Usage: SAT solving."

        "Biconditional associativity"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: biconditional associates. Equivalence: both groupings true. Proof: truth table shows. Application: multiple biconditionals. Importance: basic property. Note: requires all same truth value."

      ],
      "explanation": "Law: chaining implications valid. Validity: sound principle. Proof: from definitions. Application: logical chains. Importance: reasoning foundation. Example: 'If study then pass, if pass then graduate'."

        "Conditional standard"
      ],
      "explanation": "Implication: pq true except when p true, q false. Basis: formal logic. Alternative: subjunctive conditional. Controversy: vacuous truth counterintuitive. Importance: standard interpretation."
