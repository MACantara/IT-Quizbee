    {
      "question": "What does RAM stand for?",
      "answer": "Random Access Memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is the computer's primary memory used to temporarily store data and programs that are currently being used."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of memory is volatile?",
      "answer": "RAM",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses all stored data when power is turned off. ROM and storage devices are non-volatile."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does SSD stand for?",
      "answer": "Solid State Drive",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SSD stands for Solid State Drive. It's a storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which storage device has the fastest data access speed?",
      "answer": "Solid State Drive (SSD)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SSDs have the fastest data access speeds because they have no moving parts and use flash memory, allowing for near-instant data retrieval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ROM primarily used for?",
      "answer": "Storing firmware and system boot instructions",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "ROM (Read-Only Memory) is primarily used to store firmware and boot instructions that don't change, such as BIOS. It's non-volatile and typically cannot be modified."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many bytes are in 1 Kilobyte (KB)?",
      "answer": "1024 bytes",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "1 Kilobyte equals 1024 bytes. In computing, storage is measured in powers of 2 (2^10 = 1024), not powers of 10."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is cache memory?",
      "answer": "High-speed memory between CPU and RAM",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Cache memory is extremely fast memory located between the CPU and RAM. It stores frequently accessed data to speed up processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which optical storage device has the largest capacity?",
      "answer": "Blu-ray Disc",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Blu-ray Disc has the largest capacity among optical storage devices, storing up to 25-50GB per layer, compared to DVD (4.7GB) and CD (700MB)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is virtual memory?",
      "answer": "Hard disk space used as temporary RAM when physical RAM is full",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Virtual memory is a portion of hard disk space that the operating system uses as additional RAM when physical RAM is insufficient, though it's much slower."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is NOT a characteristic of Hard Disk Drives (HDD)?",
      "answer": "Faster than SSDs",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "HDDs are NOT faster than SSDs. HDDs use spinning magnetic platters with moving read/write heads, making them slower than solid-state drives."
