    {
      "question": "What scheduling algorithm executes processes in arrival order?",
      "answer": "First-Come First-Served",
      "alternatives": ["FCFS", "First In First Out", "FIFO"],
      "explanation": "FCFS schedules processes based on arrival time. It's simple to implement but can suffer from poor performance with mixed workloads."
    },
    {
      "question": "What algorithm executes the process with shortest CPU burst time?",
      "answer": "Shortest Job First",
      "alternatives": ["SJF", "Shortest Process Next", "SPN"],
      "explanation": "SJF minimizes average waiting time by prioritizing short processes. It can be preemptive or non-preemptive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What algorithm assigns each process a fixed time slice?",
      "answer": "Round Robin",
      "alternatives": ["RR", "Time slicing"],
      "explanation": "Round Robin allocates equal CPU time to all processes cyclically. The time quantum determines the length of each slice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What scheduling approach can interrupt executing processes?",
      "answer": "Preemptive",
      "alternatives": ["Preemptive scheduling"],
      "explanation": "Preemptive scheduling allows the OS to forcibly switch processes. This improves responsiveness and prevents CPU monopolization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What scheduling cannot interrupt running processes?",
      "answer": "Non-preemptive",
      "alternatives": ["Non-preemptive scheduling", "Cooperative"],
      "explanation": "Non-preemptive scheduling lets processes run until completion or voluntary yield. It's simpler but less responsive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What metric measures total time from arrival to completion?",
      "answer": "Turnaround time",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Turnaround time includes waiting, execution, and I/O time. It measures the complete lifecycle from submission to completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What time measures how long a process waits in the ready queue?",
      "answer": "Waiting time",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Waiting time is the sum of periods spent in the ready queue. It excludes execution and I/O time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What problem occurs when processes wait indefinitely?",
      "answer": "Starvation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Starvation happens when low-priority processes never execute because higher-priority processes keep arriving. Aging prevents this."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique gradually increases priority of waiting processes?",
      "answer": "Aging",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Aging prevents starvation by incrementing the priority of processes waiting too long. Eventually, they become high-priority."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the fixed time period allocated to each process in Round Robin?",
      "answer": "Time quantum",
      "alternatives": ["Time slice", "Quantum"],
      "explanation": "The time quantum determines how long each process runs before preemption. Smaller quanta increase responsiveness but add overhead."
