    {
      "question": "Which logical operator is represented by the symbol '∧'?",
      "answer": "Conjunction (AND)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The symbol '∧' represents conjunction (AND). The conjunction p ∧ q is true only when both p and q are true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the precedence order of logical operators from highest to lowest?",
      "answer": "NOT, AND, OR, IMPLIES",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The precedence order of logical operators is: NOT (highest), AND, OR, IMPLIES (lowest). Parentheses can override this precedence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the NAND operator produce?",
      "answer": "The negation of AND (false only when both inputs are true)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "NAND (NOT AND) produces the negation of the AND operation. It is false only when both inputs are true, and true in all other cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which operator is commutative?",
      "answer": "AND (∧) and OR (∨)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Both AND and OR operators are commutative, meaning p ∧ q = q ∧ p and p ∨ q = q ∨ p. Implication is not commutative."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the symbol for the biconditional operator?",
      "answer": "↔ or ≡",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The biconditional operator is represented by ↔ or ≡. It means 'if and only if' (iff) and is true when both propositions have the same truth value."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many inputs does a unary operator take?",
      "answer": "One",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A unary operator takes only one input. Negation (NOT) is an example of a unary operator, while AND, OR, and implication are binary operators."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the NOR operator produce?",
      "answer": "The negation of OR (true only when both inputs are false)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "NOR (NOT OR) produces the negation of the OR operation. It is true only when both inputs are false, and false in all other cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which operator is represented by the symbol '→'?",
      "answer": "Implication (conditional)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The symbol '→' represents implication (conditional). The statement p → q means 'if p then q' and is false only when p is true and q is false."
    },
    {
      "question": "What property states that (p ∧ q) ∧ r = p ∧ (q ∧ r)?",
      "answer": "Associativity",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Associativity allows regrouping of operations without changing the result. Both AND and OR operators are associative."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which logical operator is also called the exclusive disjunction?",
      "answer": "XOR",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "XOR (exclusive OR) is called the exclusive disjunction. It is true when exactly one of the two inputs is true, but not both."
