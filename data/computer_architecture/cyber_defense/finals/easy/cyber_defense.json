      "question": "What security system monitors network traffic and blocks suspicious activity?",
      "answer": "Firewall",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network firewall"
      ],
      "explanation": "Firewalls are the first line of defense in network security, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules. They can be hardware devices or software applications. Modern firewalls include stateful inspection, deep packet inspection, and application-aware filtering. Firewalls block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication."

    {
      "question": "What software detects and removes malicious programs from computers?",
      "answer": "Antivirus",
      "alternatives": [
        "Antivirus software",
        "Anti-malware"
      ],
      "explanation": "Antivirus software scans files and programs for known malware signatures, suspicious behaviors, or heuristic patterns indicating malicious intent. Modern solutions include real-time protection, automatic updates, and cloud-based threat intelligence. While essential, antivirus should be part of a layered defense strategy since new malware appears constantly."

    {
      "question": "What practice involves creating copies of data to prevent loss from failures or attacks?",
      "answer": "Backup",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data backup"
      ],
      "explanation": "Regular backups are critical for recovering from ransomware, hardware failures, or disasters. The 3-2-1 rule recommends three copies on two different media types with one offsite. Backups should be tested regularly and protected from tampering. Automated backup solutions and immutable storage help ensure recovery capability."

    {
      "question": "What security measure requires users to prove their identity before accessing resources?",
      "answer": "Authentication",
      "alternatives": [
        "User authentication"
      ],
      "explanation": "Authentication verifies user identity through credentials like passwords, biometrics, or security tokens. It's the first step in access control. Strong authentication uses multiple factors (something you know, have, or are) to increase security. Authentication prevents unauthorized access but must be followed by proper authorization to control what users can do."
    },
    {
      "question": "What security concept limits user permissions to only what's necessary for their job?",
      "answer": "Least privilege",
      "alternatives": [
        "Principle of least privilege"
      ],
      "explanation": "The principle of least privilege grants users, processes, and systems only the minimum permissions needed to perform their functions. This limits damage from compromised accounts, reduces attack surface, and helps contain breaches. Regular permission reviews and just-in-time access help maintain least privilege."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process involves applying updates to fix security vulnerabilities in software?",
      "answer": "Patching",
      "alternatives": [
        "Security patching",
        "Software updates"
      ],
      "explanation": "Patching closes security vulnerabilities by updating software with fixes from vendors. Unpatched systems are common attack vectors. Effective patch management includes testing patches, prioritizing critical updates, and maintaining inventory of all systems. Automated patch management helps ensure timely updates across large environments."

    {
      "question": "What training helps employees recognize and resist social engineering attacks?",
      "answer": "Security awareness training",
      "alternatives": [
        "Cybersecurity training"
      ],
      "explanation": "Security awareness training educates employees about threats like phishing, social engineering, and safe computing practices. Humans are often the weakest link in security. Regular training, simulated phishing exercises, and clear policies help create a security-conscious culture. Training should cover recognizing threats, reporting incidents, and following security procedures."

    {
      "question": "What security approach uses multiple defensive layers to protect systems?",
      "answer": "Defense in depth",
      "alternatives": [
        "Layered security"
      ],
      "explanation": "Defense in depth implements multiple security layers so if one fails, others provide protection. Layers include network security, host security, application security, and data security. This approach assumes breaches will occur and aims to detect, contain, and minimize damage. No single security measure is sufficient against determined attackers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What document outlines how an organization responds to security incidents?",
      "answer": "Incident response plan",
      "alternatives": [
        "IR plan",
        "Security incident response plan"
      ],
      "explanation": "An incident response plan defines procedures for detecting, responding to, recovering from, and learning from security incidents. It specifies roles, communication protocols, containment strategies, and recovery steps. Regular testing through tabletop exercises ensures the plan works when needed. Good IR plans minimize damage and recovery time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of security testing simulates real attacks to find vulnerabilities?",
      "answer": "Penetration testing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Pen testing",
        "Ethical hacking"
      ],
      "explanation": "Penetration testing involves authorized simulated attacks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors find them. Pen testers use the same tools and techniques as attackers but with permission and defined scope. Results help organizations prioritize security improvements. Regular pen testing is essential for maintaining strong security posture."
