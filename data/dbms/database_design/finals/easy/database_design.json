      "question": "A diagram used to visualize database structure with entities and relationships.",
      "answer": "Entity-Relationship diagram",
      "alternatives": ["ER diagram", "ERD"],
      "explanation": "ER diagrams show entities, attributes, and relationships in database design."

    {
      "question": "A real-world object or concept represented in a database.",
      "answer": "Entity",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Entities represent distinct things like customers, products, or orders in a database."

    {
      "question": "The number of instances of one entity that can relate to another entity.",
      "answer": "Cardinality",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Cardinality defines the numerical relationships like one-to-one or one-to-many."

    {
      "question": "Relationship where one instance of an entity relates to multiple instances of another.",
      "answer": "One-to-many",
      "alternatives": ["1:N"],
      "explanation": "One-to-many relationships are the most common, like one customer having many orders."

      "answer": "Many-to-many",
      "alternatives": ["M:N"],
      "explanation": "Many-to-many relationships require a junction table to implement in relational databases."

      "alternatives": [],

    {
      "question": "An entity that depends on another entity for its identification.",
      "answer": "Weak entity",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Weak entities cannot exist independently and require a relationship with a strong entity."

      "question": "The table used to connect two entities in a many-to-many relationship.",
      "answer": "Junction table",
      "alternatives": ["Bridge table", "Associative table"],
      "explanation": "Junction tables contain foreign keys from both entities to resolve many-to-many relationships."
