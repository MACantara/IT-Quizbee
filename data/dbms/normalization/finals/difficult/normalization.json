      "question": "What dependency exists when one attribute determines multiple independent values?",
      "answer": "Multi-valued Dependency",
      "alternatives": ["MVD"],
      "explanation": "Multi-valued dependencies occur when one attribute independently determines multiple values of another."

      "question": "What dependency is addressed by Fifth Normal Form?",
      "answer": "Join Dependency",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Join dependencies arise when a relation can only be reconstructed by joining multiple projections."

      "question": "What algorithm decomposes relations to achieve 3NF?",
      "answer": "Synthesis Algorithm",
      "alternatives": ["3NF Synthesis"],
      "explanation": "The synthesis algorithm creates 3NF decomposition while preserving dependencies."

      "question": "What algorithm decomposes relations to achieve BCNF?",
      "answer": "Decomposition Algorithm",
      "alternatives": ["BCNF Decomposition"],
      "explanation": "BCNF decomposition repeatedly splits relations based on violating functional dependencies."

      "alternatives": ["FD Closure"],
      "explanation": "The closure includes all functional dependencies logically implied by a given set."

      "question": "What axioms derive all functional dependencies from a set?",
      "answer": "Armstrong's Axioms",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Armstrong's Axioms consist of reflexivity, augmentation, and transitivity rules for FDs."

      "question": "What is the minimal set of functional dependencies called?",
      "answer": "Canonical Cover",
      "alternatives": ["Minimal Cover"],
      "explanation": "A canonical cover is the minimal equivalent set of functional dependencies."

      "question": "What normal form allows only trivial multi-valued dependencies?",
      "answer": "Fourth Normal Form",
      "alternatives": ["4NF"],
      "explanation": "4NF permits only multi-valued dependencies where the determinant is a superkey."

      "question": "What is the alternate name for Fifth Normal Form?",
      "answer": "Project-Join Normal Form",
      "alternatives": ["PJNF"],
      "explanation": "5NF is also called PJNF because it deals with projection and join operations."

      "question": "What dependency type exists when a table can't be reconstructed without loss from projections?",
      "answer": "Join Dependency",
      "alternatives": ["JD"],
      "explanation": "Join dependencies indicate a relation requires specific joins of its projections for reconstruction."
