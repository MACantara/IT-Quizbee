    {
      "question": "What is the subnet mask for a /28 network in decimal notation?",
      "answer": "255.255.255.240",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A /28 subnet mask has 28 network bits, resulting in 255.255.255.240."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many usable host addresses are in a /26 subnet?",
      "answer": "62",
      "alternatives": ["62 hosts", "sixty-two"],
      "explanation": "A /26 provides 64 total addresses minus 2 reserved addresses equals 62 usable hosts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique combines multiple networks into a single routing entry?",
      "answer": "supernetting",
      "alternatives": ["route aggregation", "CIDR aggregation"],
      "explanation": "Supernetting combines contiguous networks to reduce routing table size."

    {
      "question": "What is the network address of 192.168.1.75/28?",
      "answer": "192.168.1.64",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "With /28, the network address is found by masking the last 4 host bits to zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique allows multiple private addresses to share one public address?",
      "answer": "PAT",
      "alternatives": ["Port Address Translation", "NAT overload"],
      "explanation": "PAT uses port numbers to multiplex multiple private addresses onto one public address."

    {
      "question": "What is the first usable host address in network 10.5.2.128/26?",
      "answer": "10.5.2.129",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The first usable address is the network address plus one."

    {
      "question": "What notation represents IPv6 addresses?",
      "answer": "hexadecimal",
      "alternatives": ["colon hexadecimal notation", "hex"],
      "explanation": "IPv6 uses eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What IPv6 address represents the loopback interface?",
      "answer": "::1",
      "alternatives": ["0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001"],
      "explanation": "::1 is the abbreviated form of the IPv6 loopback address."

    {
      "question": "What technique automatically assigns IPv6 addresses without DHCP?",
      "answer": "SLAAC",
      "alternatives": ["Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"],
      "explanation": "SLAAC allows hosts to automatically configure their own IPv6 addresses."
