# Testing the Admin Dashboard with Sample Data

## Overview

Two scripts are provided to help you test the admin dashboard functionality with realistic sample data:

1. **`insert_sample_data.py`** - Creates sample quiz attempts
2. **`remove_sample_data.py`** - Removes sample data

## Quick Start

### Insert Sample Data

```bash
python scripts/insert_sample_data.py
```

This creates approximately **120-170 quiz attempts** over the last 30 days with realistic score distributions.

### Remove Sample Data

```bash
python scripts/remove_sample_data.py
```

Type `DELETE` when prompted to confirm removal.

## Insert Sample Data Script

### What It Creates

The script generates realistic quiz data across three game modes:

#### 1. Elimination Mode (60-80 attempts)
- 100 questions per attempt
- Score distribution shows learning curve:
  - **20+ days ago**: 40-70% (lower scores)
  - **10-20 days ago**: 60-80% (medium scores)
  - **0-10 days ago**: 70-95% (higher scores)
- Random times throughout the day
- Completion time: 30-60 minutes

#### 2. Finals Mode (40-60 attempts)
- 30 questions per attempt (10 easy, 10 average, 10 difficult)
- Higher scores than elimination:
  - **20+ days ago**: 50-75%
  - **10-20 days ago**: 65-85%
  - **0-10 days ago**: 75-95%
- Random difficulty levels
- Completion time: 15-30 minutes

#### 3. Review Mode (20-30 attempts)
- 10 questions per attempt
- Random topics from all 10 available topics
- Score range: 60-90%
- Completion time: 5-15 minutes

### Sample Data Features

‚úÖ **Realistic timestamps** - Spread over 30 days
‚úÖ **Learning curves** - Scores improve over time
‚úÖ **Random variations** - Different topics, difficulties, times
‚úÖ **Complete attempts** - All sessions marked as completed
‚úÖ **Proper relationships** - Sessions linked to attempts

### Usage

```bash
python scripts/insert_sample_data.py
```

**Interactive prompts:**
- If sample data exists, asks to remove and recreate
- Confirms before proceeding

**Expected output:**
```

## Testing the Admin Dashboard

### Step-by-Step Testing Guide

#### 1. Prepare Database
```bash
# Ensure database is initialized
python scripts/init_db.py
```

#### 2. Insert Sample Data
```bash
python scripts/insert_sample_data.py
```

#### 3. Start Application
```bash
python app.py
```

#### 4. View Dashboard
Open browser to: `http://localhost:5000/admin`

#### 5. Verify Charts and Data

- [ ] Average Score shows realistic percentage
- [ ] Popular Mode shows "Elimination"
- [ ] Completed Sessions matches total attempts

**Performance by Mode Chart:**
- [ ] Shows three modes with different heights
- [ ] Elimination has most attempts
- [ ] Finals has fewer attempts
- [ ] Review has fewest attempts

**Performance by Difficulty Chart:**

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Empty Database
```bash
python scripts/remove_sample_data.py
# Dashboard should show "No quiz attempts yet"
```

### Scenario 2: Small Dataset
Modify `insert_sample_data.py` to create fewer attempts:
- Change `random.randint(60, 80)` to `random.randint(5, 10)`
- Test with minimal data

### Scenario 3: Large Dataset
Modify ranges to create more data:
- Change to `random.randint(100, 200)`
- Test dashboard performance with large dataset

### Scenario 4: Recent Data Only
Modify date range:
- Change `timedelta(days=30)` to `timedelta(days=7)`
- Test trend charts with limited date range

### Scenario 5: Different Score Distributions
Modify score ranges in `generate_sample_answers()`:
- Test with all high scores (80-100)
- Test with all low scores (20-50)
- Test with very random scores

## Troubleshooting

### Sample Data Not Showing

**Problem:** Dashboard shows no data after inserting

**Solutions:**
1. Check database connection:
   ```bash
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

2. Verify data was inserted:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/summary
   ```

3. Check for errors in browser console (F12)

4. Restart Flask application

### Cannot Remove Sample Data

**Problem:** Script says no sample data found

**Solutions:**
1. Check if data was actually inserted
2. Verify database connection
3. Check session IDs start with `sample-`

### Charts Not Loading

**Problem:** Dashboard loads but charts are empty

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Chart.js CDN is accessible
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check API endpoints return data

### Database Errors

**Problem:** MySQL connection errors

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure MySQL server is running
2. Check `.env` file for correct credentials
3. Verify database exists:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's

- **Always test with sample data first** before using real data
- **Remove sample data** before deploying to production
- **Use version control** before running scripts
- **Backup database** before removing all data
- **Test incrementally** - start small, then increase data

### ‚ùå Don'ts

- **Don't use `--all` flag** unless absolutely necessary
- **Don't mix sample and real data** in production
- **Don't skip confirmations** - they exist for safety
- **Don't modify sample data manually** in database
- **Don't test in production** environment
