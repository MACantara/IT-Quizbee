    {
      "question": "What is authentication in operating systems?",
      "answer": "Verifying the identity of a user or process",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device. Common methods include passwords, biometrics, security tokens, and multi-factor authentication (MFA)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is authorization?",
      "answer": "Determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Authorization determines what actions or resources an authenticated user or process is permitted to access. It's about permissions and access control, enforced after authentication succeeds."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are access control lists (ACLs)?",
      "answer": "Lists of users and their permitted operations on resources",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Access Control Lists (ACLs) specify which users or processes can access particular resources and what operations they can perform (read, write, execute, delete). Each resource has an ACL defining permissions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the principle of least privilege?",
      "answer": "Users should have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The principle of least privilege states that users and processes should be granted only the minimum permissions necessary to accomplish their tasks. This limits damage from accidents or attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security vulnerability?",
      "answer": "A weakness in a system that can be exploited to compromise security",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A security vulnerability is a weakness, flaw, or bug in a system that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause harm. Examples: buffer overflows, SQL injection, privilege escalation bugs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a buffer overflow attack?",
      "answer": "Too much data is written to a buffer, overwriting adjacent memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory. Attackers exploit this to inject malicious code or crash the system. Modern OSes use protections like ASLR and DEP."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is encryption?",
      "answer": "Converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Encryption transforms data into a coded form (ciphertext) using an algorithm and key, making it unreadable without the decryption key. Used to protect data confidentiality in storage and transmission."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a firewall?",
      "answer": "A security system that monitors and controls network traffic based on rules",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A firewall is a security system that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is malware?",
      "answer": "Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or compromise a system",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage, steal data, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt systems. Types include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is sandboxing?",
      "answer": "Running untrusted code in an isolated environment to limit potential damage",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Sandboxing is a security technique that runs programs in an isolated environment with restricted access to system resources. If the sandboxed program is malicious or crashes, it can't harm the rest of the system."
