      "question": "What testing technique introduces small faults to verify tests detect them?",
      "answer": "Mutation Testing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Mutation Testing creates modified versions of code with small changes to verify that test cases can detect these intentional defects.",

      "question": "What testing approach verifies properties that should always hold true?",
      "answer": "Property-Based Testing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Property-Based Testing defines invariants or properties that should always be true and generates test cases automatically to verify these properties.",

      "question": "What testing verifies two services can communicate correctly?",
      "answer": "Contract Testing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Contract Testing verifies that services can communicate by ensuring the provider's responses match the consumer's expectations defined in a contract.",
