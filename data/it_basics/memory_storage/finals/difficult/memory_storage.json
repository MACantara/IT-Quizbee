    {
      "question": "Cache level shared between cores but still on the CPU chip.",
      "answer": "L2 cache",
      "alternatives": ["Level 2 cache"],
      "explanation": "L2 cache is larger than L1 and may be shared among cores."
    },
    {
      "question": "Largest cache level, often shared across all CPU cores.",
      "answer": "L3 cache",
      "alternatives": ["Level 3 cache"],
      "explanation": "L3 cache is the slowest but largest on-chip cache level."
    },
    {
      "question": "RAM type that transfers data on both clock edges for double speed.",
      "answer": "DDR",
      "alternatives": ["Double Data Rate"],
      "explanation": "DDR RAM transfers data twice per clock cycle for improved performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Storage technique that distributes data across multiple drives for performance.",
      "answer": "RAID 0",
      "alternatives": ["Striping"],
      "explanation": "RAID 0 stripes data across drives for faster read/write but no redundancy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Storage technique that mirrors data across drives for redundancy.",
      "answer": "RAID 1",
      "alternatives": ["Mirroring"],
      "explanation": "RAID 1 duplicates data on multiple drives for fault tolerance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Memory addressing mode using both physical and virtual addresses.",
      "answer": "Paging",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Paging divides memory into fixed-size pages for virtual memory management."
    },
    {
      "question": "The time taken for a storage device to locate and begin reading data.",
      "answer": "Seek time",
      "alternatives": ["Access time"],
      "explanation": "Seek time is the delay before data transfer begins, especially relevant for HDDs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Flash storage type that stores multiple bits per cell.",
      "answer": "MLC",
      "alternatives": ["Multi-Level Cell"],
      "explanation": "MLC stores 2+ bits per cell, offering higher capacity but slower speeds than SLC."
    },
    {
      "question": "Flash storage type that stores three bits per cell.",
      "answer": "TLC",
      "alternatives": ["Triple-Level Cell"],
      "explanation": "TLC provides more capacity at lower cost but with reduced endurance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Memory cache policy that replaces the least recently used data.",
      "answer": "LRU",
      "alternatives": ["Least Recently Used"],
      "explanation": "LRU replacement policy evicts the data that hasn't been accessed for the longest time."
