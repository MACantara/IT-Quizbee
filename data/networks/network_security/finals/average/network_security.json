      "question": "What is SSL/TLS?",
      "answer": "Secure communication protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Encryption protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "SSL: legacy standard (deprecated). TLS: modern replacement. Version: 1.2, 1.3 secure. Port: 443 (HTTPS). Purpose: encrypted communication. Importance: fundamental security."

      "question": "What is a certificate?",
      "answer": "Digital identity proof",
      "alternatives": [
        "Digital cert"
      ],
      "explanation": "Certificate: public key + identity. Issuer: Certificate Authority. Validation: trust chain. Expiration: periodic renewal. HTTPS: requires certificate. Importance: trust mechanism."

      "question": "What is a cipher?",
      "answer": "Encryption algorithm",
      "alternatives": [
        "Encryption algo"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cipher: mathematical procedure. Types: block, stream. Strength: key size matters. Modern: AES common. Security: depends on algorithm. Importance: encryption foundation."

      "question": "What is a digital signature?",
      "answer": "Proof of authenticity",
      "alternatives": [
        "Authentication proof"
      ],
      "explanation": "Signature: asymmetric signature. Purpose: authenticity, non-repudiation. Verification: public key. Forgery: computationally hard. Usage: documents, software. Importance: authenticity."

    {
      "question": "What is a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)?",
      "answer": "System for digital certificates",
      "alternatives": [
        "Certificate system"
      ],
      "explanation": "PKI: manages certificates. Components: CA, RA, repository. Purpose: trust foundation. Issuance: certificate lifecycle. Revocation: CRL, OCSP. Importance: internet foundation."

      "question": "What is access control?",
      "answer": "Restricting resource access",
      "alternatives": [
        "Permission system"
      ],
      "explanation": "Control: who can access what. Methods: ACLs, roles, policies. Purpose: security enforcement. Levels: physical, logical. Types: DAC, MAC, RBAC. Importance: fundamental security."

      "question": "What is RBAC?",
      "answer": "Role-Based Access Control",
      "alternatives": [
        "Role-based security"
      ],
      "explanation": "RBAC: access by role. Benefits: simplified management. Implementation: role assignments. Example: admin, user, guest. Scalability: works for large organizations. Importance: enterprise standard."

      "question": "What is least privilege?",
      "answer": "Minimal necessary permissions",
      "alternatives": [
        "Minimum access"
      ],
      "explanation": "Privilege: grant only needed. Purpose: reduce attack surface. Security: best practice. Implementation: role-based. Monitoring: audit access. Importance: fundamental principle."
