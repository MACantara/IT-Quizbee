      "answer": "Determine network parameters",
      "alternatives": [
        "Subnet math"
      ],
      "explanation": "Calculation: network, broadcast, usable IPs. Method: binary conversion. Example: 192.168.1.0/25. Subnets: 192.168.1.0/25, 192.168.1.128/25. Importance: network design."

      "question": "What is a network address?",
      "answer": "First address in subnet",
      "alternatives": [
        "Subnet start"
      ],
      "explanation": "Address: host bits all 0s. Example: 192.168.1.0 in 192.168.1.0/24. Used: identifies network. Not assigned: to devices. Importance: addressing standard."
    },

      "question": "What is a broadcast address?",
      "answer": "Last address in subnet",
      "alternatives": [
        "Subnet end"
      ],
      "explanation": "Address: host bits all 1s. Example: 192.168.1.255 in 192.168.1.0/24. Purpose: send to all hosts. Not assigned: to devices. Importance: addressing standard."

      "question": "What is a gateway?",
      "answer": "Exit point to other networks",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network exit"
      ],
      "explanation": "Gateway: router IP address. Function: forwards packets outside. Configuration: each device needs. Typical: 192.168.1.1. Importance: network communication."

      "answer": "Maps IP to MAC address",
      "alternatives": [
        "Address mapping"
      ],
      "explanation": "ARP: finds MAC from IP. Local network: broadcasts request. Cache: stores results. TTL: temporary storage. Usage: layer 2 delivery. Importance: local network."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a MAC address?",
      "answer": "Hardware physical address",
      "alternatives": [
        "Physical address"
      ],
      "explanation": "MAC: 48-bit identifier. Format: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E. Scope: local network. Burned: on NIC. Assignment: manufacturer. Importance: layer 2 addressing."

      "answer": "Translates IP addresses",
      "alternatives": [
        "Address translation"
      ],
      "explanation": "NAT: private to public conversion. Purpose: security, address conservation. Types: static, dynamic. PAT: port-based variant. Usage: home routers. Importance: security/efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is PAT (Port Address Translation)?",
      "answer": "Maps port and address",
      "alternatives": [
        "Port translation"
      ],
      "explanation": "PAT: many-to-one translation. Method: port numbers differentiate. Benefit: multiple internal to one external. Efficiency: resource friendly. Usage: common in NAT. Importance: conservation."

    {
      "question": "What is a default route?",
      "answer": "Route for unknown destinations",
      "alternatives": [
        "Default gateway"
      ],
      "explanation": "Route: 0.0.0.0/0 (all addresses). Function: catch-all for packets. Used: if no match. Metric: lowest priority. Importance: packet forwarding."

      "question": "What is DNS resolution?",
      "answer": "Convert domain to IP",
      "alternatives": [
        "Name to IP"
      ],
      "explanation": "Resolution: recursive process. Steps: query -> recursive resolver -> authoritative. Caching: speeds future lookups. TTL: cache duration. Importance: web browsing."
