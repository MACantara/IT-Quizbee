      "question": "What is Layer 5 (Session)?",
      "answer": "Connection management and dialogue",
      "alternatives": [
        "Session layer"
      ],
      "explanation": "Layer 5: conversation management. Task: establish, maintain, terminate. Sessions: authentication, authorization. Example: login sessions. Complexity: less commonly implemented. Importance: conversation control."

      "answer": "Protocol Data Unit at each layer",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "PDU: layer-specific format. Names: data, segment, packet, frame. Each: layer adds headers. Example: frame at layer 2. Importance: encapsulation concept. Task: segment data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is encapsulation?",
      "answer": "Adding headers at each layer",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data wrapping"
      ],
      "explanation": "Encapsulation: wrap data in headers. Process: top-down through layers. Headers: contain control information. Purpose: routing, delivery. De-encapsulation: unwrap at destination. Importance: fundamental concept."
