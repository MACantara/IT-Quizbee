    {
      "question": "What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)?",
      "answer": "Inter-domain routing protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "External routing"
      ],
      "explanation": "BGP: connects autonomous systems. Scalability: internet backbone. Path: policy-based. Version: BGPv4. Attributes: AS_PATH, NEXT_HOP. Complexity: sophisticated algorithms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an autonomous system (AS)?",
      "answer": "Network under single administration",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network domain"
      ],
      "explanation": "AS: collection of routers. Control: single admin. ASN: autonomous system number. BGP: exchanges routes. Example: ISP network. Importance: internet structure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)?",
      "answer": "Interior gateway protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Internal routing"
      ],
      "explanation": "OSPF: link-state routing. Algorithm: Dijkstra. Convergence: fast. Scalability: moderate. Areas: can subdivide. Importance: enterprise routing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is RIP (Routing Information Protocol)?",
      "answer": "Distance-vector routing",
      "alternatives": [
        "Legacy routing"
      ],
      "explanation": "RIP: oldest routing protocol. Metric: hop count. Limit: maximum 15 hops. Update: periodic. Disadvantage: slow convergence. Modern: rarely used. Importance: historical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a routing table?",
      "answer": "Database of route information",
      "alternatives": [
        "Route database"
      ],
      "explanation": "Table: destination, gateway, metric, flags. Lookup: find best match. Static: manually configured. Dynamic: automatically updated. Query: route command. Importance: packet forwarding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is network address aggregation?",
      "answer": "Combining multiple routes",
      "alternatives": [
        "Route summarization"
      ],
      "explanation": "Aggregation: reduce routing entries. Method: group addresses. Benefit: smaller routing tables. Complexity: calculation needed. CIDR: enables aggregation. Importance: scalability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is DiffServ?",
      "answer": "Differentiated Services",
      "alternatives": [
        "QoS mechanism"
      ],
      "explanation": "DiffServ: mark packets for priority. DSCP: field marks priority. Classes: multiple service levels. Scalability: domain-based. vs IntServ: resource reservation. Application: VoIP, video."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is traffic shaping?",
      "answer": "Rate limiting data flow",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bandwidth control"
      ],
      "explanation": "Shaping: control data rate. Bucket: token/leaky bucket algorithm. Purpose: prevent congestion. Implementation: edge routers. Benefit: predictable service. vs Policing: discard excess."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is packet filtering?",
      "answer": "Allow/deny packets by rules",
      "alternatives": [
        "Firewall rules"
      ],
      "explanation": "Filtering: stateless inspection. Rules: source, destination, port, protocol. Application: firewalls. Limitation: basic security. Modern: stateful, deep inspection. Importance: first defense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is stateful inspection?",
      "answer": "Tracking connection states",
      "alternatives": [
        "Connection tracking"
      ],
      "explanation": "Inspection: maintain state table. Memory: connection info stored. Security: better than stateless. Complexity: more processing. Application: modern firewalls. Benefit: security improvement."
