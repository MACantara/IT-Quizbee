    {
      "question": "What is network address translation (NAT)?",
      "answer": "Mapping private IPs to public",
      "alternatives": [
        "IP translation"
      ],
      "explanation": "NAT: converts addresses. Private: 10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x. Public: global addresses. Purpose: IP conservation, security. Types: static, dynamic. Complexity: breaks some protocols. Application: home routers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?",
      "answer": "Maps IP to MAC addresses",
      "alternatives": [
        "Address mapping"
      ],
      "explanation": "ARP: IP to physical address translation. Query: broadcast request. Response: unicast reply. Caching: stores mappings. Purpose: local network communication. Security: ARP spoofing possible. Importance: layer 2-3 bridge."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ICMP?",
      "answer": "Internet Control Message Protocol",
      "alternatives": [
        "Control protocol"
      ],
      "explanation": "ICMP: error reporting, diagnostics. Uses: ping (ECHO request), traceroute. Messages: destination unreachable, timeout. Purpose: network troubleshooting. Importance: debugging tool. Security: can be abused."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)?",
      "answer": "Largest packet size",
      "alternatives": [
        "Packet size limit"
      ],
      "explanation": "MTU: maximum payload size. Default: 1500 bytes (Ethernet). Fragmentation: split if larger. Path MTU discovery: find optimal size. Impact: performance. Trade-off: size vs efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is congestion control?",
      "answer": "Preventing network overload",
      "alternatives": [
        "Flow management"
      ],
      "explanation": "Control: additive increase, multiplicative decrease. Algorithm: AIMD (TCP). Timeout: indicates congestion. Cwnd: congestion window. Purpose: stability, fairness. Complexity: mathematical models. Importance: network stability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is flow control?",
      "answer": "Matching sender/receiver speed",
      "alternatives": [
        "Speed matching"
      ],
      "explanation": "Control: prevent receiver overflow. Mechanism: ACK and window size. Window: buffer capacity. Sliding window: efficient method. Purpose: prevent data loss. Importance: reliability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is sequence number?",
      "answer": "Order tracking in TCP",
      "alternatives": [
        "Packet ordering"
      ],
      "explanation": "Sequence: 32-bit counter. Initial: random value. Purpose: detect duplicates, order packets. Wraparound: 4 billion bytes. Importance: ensures correct delivery. Complexity: wraparound handling."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is acknowledgment?",
      "answer": "Receipt confirmation in TCP",
      "alternatives": [
        "Confirmation"
      ],
      "explanation": "ACK: confirms received bytes. Format: sequence number of next expected. Piggybacking: combined with data. Delayed: sometimes batched. Loss: triggers retransmission. Importance: reliability mechanism."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is windowing?",
      "answer": "Sending multiple packets before ACK",
      "alternatives": [
        "Pipelined transmission"
      ],
      "explanation": "Window: sender buffer size. Sliding: moves as ACKs received. Efficiency: pipelined transmission. Size: dynamic adjustment. Purpose: throughput optimization. Complexity: coordination needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is network simulation?",
      "answer": "Modeling network behavior",
      "alternatives": [
        "Network modeling"
      ],
      "explanation": "Simulation: test protocols, designs. Tools: NS-3, Cisco Packet Tracer. Purpose: before deployment testing. Parameters: traffic, topology, failures. Benefit: risk reduction. Limitation: models approximate reality."
