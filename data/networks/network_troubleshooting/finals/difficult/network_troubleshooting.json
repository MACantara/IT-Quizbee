    {
      "question": "What is a network baseline?",
      "answer": "Documented normal performance",
      "alternatives": [
        "Performance reference"
      ],
      "explanation": "Baseline: baseline metrics. Purpose: identify abnormal behavior. Data: latency, packet loss, bandwidth. Collection: periodic. Benefit: anomaly detection. Importance: troubleshooting foundation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is root cause analysis?",
      "answer": "Identifying problem source",
      "alternatives": [
        "Problem investigation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Analysis: systematically find cause. Method: trace symptoms to source. Tools: logs, monitoring. Approach: methodical investigation. Benefit: proper fix. Importance: problem solving."

      "question": "What is the OSI model troubleshooting?",
      "answer": "Bottom-up problem solving",
      "alternatives": [
        "Layer analysis"
      ],
      "explanation": "Approach: start layer 1 (physical). Check: each layer. Benefit: systematic. Example: check cables, then data link. Tools: vary by layer. Importance: structured approach."

      "question": "What is a network sniffer",
      "answer": "Passive traffic monitor",
      "alternatives": [
        "Listener"
      ],
      "explanation": "Sniffer: listens to traffic. Purpose: analysis, troubleshooting. Passive: no interference. Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump. Limitation: local traffic only. Importance: observation tool."

      "question": "What is port mirroring?",
      "answer": "Copy port traffic elsewhere",
      "alternatives": [
        "SPAN"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mirroring: duplicate traffic. Purpose: monitoring. Active: uses switch resources. Configuration: SPAN (Cisco). Limitation: performance impact. Importance: monitoring technique."

      "question": "What is link aggregation?",
      "answer": "Combine multiple links",
      "alternatives": [
        "Port bundling"
      ],
      "explanation": "Aggregation: parallel links. Benefit: bandwidth increase, redundancy. Technology: LAG, LACP. Configuration: switch. Purpose: performance, availability. Importance: advanced technique."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network loop?",
      "answer": "Circular packet path",
      "alternatives": [
        "Circular routing"
      ],
      "explanation": "Loop: packets circle endlessly. Cause: redundant connections without blocking. Result: broadcast storm. Solution: STP. Prevention: careful topology. Importance: network issue."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a broadcast storm?",
      "answer": "Excessive broadcast traffic",
      "alternatives": [
        "Broadcast flood"
      ],
      "explanation": "Storm: broadcasts propagate. Cause: network loop. Effect: network saturation. Solution: STP, VLAN. Prevention: topology. Importance: serious problem."

    {
      "question": "What is the three-way handshake?",
      "answer": "TCP connection establishment",
      "alternatives": [
        "TCP sync"
      ],
      "explanation": "Handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK. Purpose: establish connection. Sequence: three packets. Flags: set appropriately. Termination: FIN-ACK. Importance: connection fundamental."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)?",
      "answer": "Largest packet size",
      "alternatives": [
        "Packet size limit"
      ],
      "explanation": "MTU: typically 1500 bytes. Ethernet: standard size. Jumbo: 9000 bytes possible. Path: MTU varies. Discovery: PMTUD. Impact: fragmentation. Importance: performance tuning."
