        "10",
        "16"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The binary number system has a base of 2, using only two digits: 0 and 1. It's the fundamental number system used in computing."

      "question": "What is the decimal equivalent of binary 1010?",
      "options": [
        "8",
        "10",
        "12",
        "16"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Binary 1010 equals decimal 10. Calculation: (1×2³) + (0×2²) + (1×2¹) + (0×2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which number system uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F?",
      "options": [
        "Binary",
        "Octal",
        "Hexadecimal",
        "Decimal"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Hexadecimal (base 16) uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F, where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, and F=15."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the hexadecimal equivalent of decimal 15?",
      "options": [
        "E",
        "D",
        "10",
        "F"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Decimal 15 equals F in hexadecimal. In hex, A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, and F=15."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the octal number system's base?",

        "8",
        "10",
        "2",
        "16"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The octal number system has a base of 8, using digits 0 through 7. It's sometimes used in computing for representing binary data more compactly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many bits are in 1 byte?",
      "options": [
        "4",
        "8",
        "16",
        "32"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "1 byte consists of 8 bits. A bit is the smallest unit of data (0 or 1), and a byte can represent 256 different values (2⁸)."

    {
      "question": "What is the binary equivalent of decimal 5?",
      "options": [
        "100",
        "110",
        "101",
        "111"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Decimal 5 equals binary 101. Calculation: 5 = (1×2²) + (0×2¹) + (1×2⁰) = 4 + 0 + 1 = 101₂."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which prefix represents hexadecimal numbers in programming?",
      "options": [
        "0b",
        "0o",
        "0d",
        "0x"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The prefix 0x (or 0X) is commonly used to denote hexadecimal numbers in programming. For example, 0xFF represents decimal 255."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a nibble in computing?",
      "options": [
        "4 bits (half a byte)",
        "2 bits",
        "16 bits",
        "1 byte"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A nibble is 4 bits, which is half of a byte. It can represent 16 different values (0-15) and corresponds to one hexadecimal digit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is hexadecimal commonly used in computing?",
      "options": [
        "It's easier than decimal",
        "It provides a compact way to represent binary data",
        "Computers only understand hexadecimal",
        "It's faster to process"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hexadecimal is commonly used because it provides a compact, human-readable way to represent binary data. Each hex digit represents exactly 4 binary bits."
