      "question": "What is a computer?",
      "answer": "Electronic device that processes data",
      "alternatives": [
        "Computing machine",
        "Data processor"
      ],
      "explanation": "Computer: programmable electronic device processing input data into output. Components: CPU (processor), memory, storage, I/O devices. Purpose: automate tasks, store information, process data. Evolution: from room-size mainframes to personal devices. Ubiquitous: phones, laptops, servers, embedded systems. Impact: revolutionized society."

      "question": "What manages computer resources?",
      "answer": "Operating System",
      "alternatives": [
        "OS"
      ],
      "explanation": "Operating System manages hardware resources. Functions: process management, memory management, file systems, I/O control. Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android. User interface: command-line or graphical. Resource allocation: fair, efficient. Abstraction: hides hardware complexity. Essential: every computer needs OS."

      "question": "What executes program instructions?",
      "answer": "CPU",
      "alternatives": [
        "Processor",
        "Central Processing Unit"
      ],
      "explanation": "CPU executes program instructions. Components: control unit (directs), ALU (arithmetic logic). Clock: synchronizes operations. Speed: measured in GHz (billions cycles/second). Multiple cores: parallel processing. Thermal: generates heat, needs cooling. Performance: bottleneck often here."

      "question": "What temporarily stores data?",
      "answer": "RAM",
      "alternatives": [
        "Random Access Memory"
      ],
      "explanation": "RAM temporarily stores running program data. Speed: very fast access. Volatile: loses data on power-off. Capacity: KB to GB (modern). Cost: expensive per GB. Speed-capacity tradeoff: faster = more expensive. Upgrade: improves multitasking. Sufficient RAM: prevents slowdowns."

    {
      "question": "What permanently stores data?",
      "answer": "Storage",
      "alternatives": [
        "Hard drive",
        "SSD",
        "Secondary storage"
      ],
      "explanation": "Storage permanently holds data. Types: HDD (mechanical), SSD (electronic), optical. Speed: slower than RAM. Capacity: GB to TB. Persistent: survives power-off. Reliability: critical importance. Backup: essential protection. Full storage: slows performance."

    {
      "question": "What connects computer parts?",
      "answer": "Motherboard",
      "alternatives": [
        "Main board"
      ],
      "explanation": "Motherboard connects all components. Contains: CPU socket, RAM slots, connectors, chipset. Buses: transfer data between components. Power distribution: provides electricity. Expansion: add cards (GPU, network). Failure: computer non-functional. Upgrade: limited options."
    },
    {
      "question": "What powers the computer?",
      "answer": "Power Supply",
      "alternatives": [
        "PSU"
      ],
      "explanation": "Power Supply provides electrical power. Converts: AC to DC for components. Wattage: must handle system needs. Efficiency: reduces waste heat. Failure: complete shutdown. Upgrade: necessary for power-hungry components. Capacity: headroom prevents overload."
    },
    {
      "question": "What input device enters text?",
      "answer": "Keyboard",
      "alternatives": [
        "Input device"
      ],
      "explanation": "Keyboard inputs text and commands. Layout: QWERTY standard (US). Types: mechanical, membrane, wireless. Ergonomic: RSI prevention. Shortcuts: productivity boost. Gaming: mechanical preferred for tactile feedback. Error: typos common."

    {
      "question": "What points on screen?",
      "answer": "Mouse",
      "alternatives": [
        "Pointing device"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mouse controls cursor on screen. Types: mechanical, optical, wireless, trackpad. Precision: select small items. Ergonomic: hand position matters. Sensitivity: adjustable. Left/right click: different actions. Scroll: wheel navigates documents."
    },
    {
      "question": "What displays information?",
      "answer": "Monitor",
      "alternatives": [
        "Display",
        "Screen"
      ],
      "explanation": "Monitor displays visual output. Resolution: pixels (width x height). Size: measured diagonally. Types: LCD, OLED, CRT (obsolete). Refresh rate: smoothness (Hz). Color depth: colors available (bits). Eye strain: monitor position important. Multiple: productivity boost."
