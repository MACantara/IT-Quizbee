    {
      "question": "What is a proposition in logic?",
      "options": [
        "A statement that can be either true or false, but not both",
        "A mathematical equation",
        "A question",
        "A command"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A proposition is a declarative statement that has a definite truth value - it is either true or false, but not both. For example, '2 + 2 = 4' is a proposition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a proposition?",
      "options": [
        "The sky is blue",
        "2 + 3 = 5",
        "What time is it?",
        "All birds can fly"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "'What time is it?' is a question, not a declarative statement, so it cannot be classified as true or false. Therefore, it is not a proposition."

    {
      "question": "What does the symbol '¬' represent in propositional logic?",
      "options": [
        "Conjunction (AND)",
        "Disjunction (OR)",
        "Negation (NOT)",
        "Implication"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The symbol '¬' (or sometimes '~' or '!') represents negation (NOT) in propositional logic. It reverses the truth value of a proposition."
    },
    {
      "question": "In propositional logic, what is a compound proposition?",
      "options": [
        "A simple statement",
        "A false statement",
        "A question",
        "A proposition formed by combining simple propositions using logical operators"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A compound proposition is formed by combining two or more simple propositions using logical connectives (AND, OR, NOT, etc.). For example, 'It is raining AND it is cold.'"

    {
      "question": "If p is true and q is false, what is the truth value of p ∧ q (p AND q)?",
      "options": [
        "False",
        "True",
        "Unknown",
        "Both true and false"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The conjunction (AND) operation is only true when both propositions are true. Since q is false, p ∧ q is false regardless of p being true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the symbol for disjunction (OR) in propositional logic?",
      "options": [
        "∧",
        "∨",
        "→",
        "↔"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The symbol '∨' represents disjunction (OR) in propositional logic. The disjunction p ∨ q is true when at least one of p or q is true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a tautology in propositional logic?",
      "options": [
        "A proposition that is always false",
        "A proposition that can be true or false",
        "A proposition that is always true",
        "A proposition with no truth value"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A tautology is a compound proposition that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its component propositions. For example, p ∨ ¬p is always true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a contradiction in propositional logic?",
      "options": [
        "A true proposition",
        "A proposition with unknown value",
        "A compound proposition",
        "A proposition that is always false"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A contradiction is a compound proposition that is always false, regardless of the truth values of its components. For example, p ∧ ¬p is always false."
    },
    {
      "question": "If p is false, what is the truth value of ¬p?",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False",
        "Unknown",
        "Depends on context"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Negation (¬) reverses the truth value of a proposition. If p is false, then ¬p (NOT p) is true."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the principle of bivalence in propositional logic?",
      "options": [
        "Every proposition can have multiple truth values",
        "Every proposition is either true or false, but not both",
        "Propositions can be neither true nor false",
        "Truth values depend on context"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The principle of bivalence states that every proposition has exactly one of two truth values: true or false, and no proposition can be both or neither."
