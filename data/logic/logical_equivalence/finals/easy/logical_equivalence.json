    {
      "question": "What is logical equivalence?",
      "answer": "Two formulas with identical truth values",
      "alternatives": [
        "Same truth value"
      ],
      "explanation": "Equivalence: pq when same value always. Notation: pq or pq. Truth table: identical result columns. Implication: can substitute one for other. Importance: simplification, optimization."
    },

      "question": "What does  mean?",
      "answer": "Logically equivalent",
      "alternatives": [
        "Equivalence symbol"
      ],
      "explanation": "Symbol:  represents equivalence. Meaning: always have same truth value. Difference:  in formula vs  about formulas. Meta-logical:  is about formulas. Notation: standard in logic."

      "question": "What is De Morgan's Law 1?",
      "answer": "(pq)  pq",
      "alternatives": [
        "Negation of AND"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: negate AND becomes OR of negations. Proof: truth table verification. Example: 'not (raining and cold)'  'not raining or not cold'. Application: formula transformation. Importance: fundamental law."

    {
      "question": "What is De Morgan's Law 2?",
      "answer": "(pq)  pq",
      "alternatives": [
        "Negation of OR"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: negate OR becomes AND of negations. Proof: truth table verification. Example: 'not (coffee or tea)'  'not coffee and not tea'. Application: formula transformation. Importance: fundamental law."

      "question": "What is the commutative law?",
      "answer": "pq  qp and pq  qp",
      "alternatives": [
        "Order independence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: order doesn't matter for AND, OR. Equivalence: both directions true. Proof: truth table identical. Application: reordering formulas. Importance: simplification."

      "question": "What is the associative law?",
      "answer": "(pq)r  p(qr)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Grouping independence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: grouping doesn't matter for AND, OR. Equivalence: both directions true. Proof: truth table identical. Application: parentheses unnecessary. Importance: simplification."

      "question": "What is the distributive law?",
      "answer": "p(qr)  (pq)(pr)",
      "alternatives": [
        "Distribution"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: AND distributes over OR. Equivalence: both directions true. Proof: truth table verification. Application: formula expansion, circuit design. Importance: fundamental law."

      "question": "What is the identity law?",
      "answer": "pT  p and pF  p",
      "alternatives": [
        "Identity element"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: AND with true preserves, OR with false preserves. Equivalence: both formulas same. Proof: obvious from truth table. Application: simplification. Importance: basic property."

      "question": "What is the domination law?",
      "answer": "pF  F and pT  T",
      "alternatives": [
        "Dominance"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: AND with false always false, OR with true always true. Equivalence: absorbing elements. Proof: truth table. Application: simplification. Importance: basic property."

        "Self equivalence"
      ],
      "explanation": "Law: AND/OR with self unchanged. Equivalence: both directions true. Proof: truth table shows. Application: remove duplicates. Importance: simplification."
