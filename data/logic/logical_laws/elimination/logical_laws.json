      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The identity law for conjunction states that p ∧ T ≡ p. Combining any proposition with TRUE using AND preserves the original proposition."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The idempotent law states that p ∧ p ≡ p and p ∨ p ≡ p. Combining a proposition with itself using AND or OR gives the same proposition."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The associative law allows regrouping: (p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r) and (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r). Parentheses can be moved without changing the result."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The absorption law states that p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p and p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p. The proposition 'absorbs' the compound expression."

      "explanation": "According to the negation laws, ¬T ≡ F and ¬F ≡ T. The negation of TRUE is FALSE."
