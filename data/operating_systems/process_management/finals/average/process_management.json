    {
      "question": "What is a process?",
      "answer": "A program in execution with its own memory space and resources",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A process is an instance of a program in execution. It includes the program code, current activity (program counter), stack, heap, data section, and allocated resources. A program becomes a process when loaded into memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main process states?",
      "answer": "New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The five main process states are: New (being created), Ready (waiting for CPU), Running (executing), Waiting/Blocked (waiting for I/O or event), and Terminated (finished execution). Processes transition between these states."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Process Control Block (PCB)?",
      "answer": "A data structure containing information about a process",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure that stores all information about a process: process state, program counter, CPU registers, memory limits, list of open files, scheduling information, and process ID."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a process and a thread?",
      "answer": "A process has its own memory space; threads within a process share memory",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A process is an independent execution unit with its own memory space. Threads are lightweight execution units within a process that share the same memory space, making communication easier but requiring synchronization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is context switching?",
      "answer": "Saving the state of a process and loading the state of another process",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Context switching is the process of storing the state (context) of a currently running process so it can be resumed later, and loading the stored state of another process to run it. This enables multitasking but has overhead."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the fork() system call?",
      "answer": "A call that creates a new child process identical to the parent",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "fork() is a Unix/Linux system call that creates a new child process by duplicating the calling (parent) process. The child gets a copy of the parent's memory space. fork() returns 0 to the child and the child's PID to the parent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a zombie process?",
      "answer": "A terminated process whose exit status hasn't been read by its parent",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A zombie (defunct) process is one that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent hasn't read its exit status using wait(). It holds a PID but uses no other resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an orphan process?",
      "answer": "A process whose parent has terminated before it",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "An orphan process is one whose parent process has terminated or finished before the child. In Unix/Linux, orphan processes are adopted by the init process (PID 1), which becomes their new parent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Inter-Process Communication (IPC)?",
      "answer": "Mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and synchronize",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Inter-Process Communication (IPC) refers to mechanisms that allow processes to exchange data and coordinate their actions. Common IPC methods include pipes, message queues, shared memory, semaphores, and sockets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is multithreading?",
      "answer": "Running multiple threads within a single process to achieve parallelism",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Multithreading is the ability of a CPU or a single process to execute multiple threads concurrently. Threads share the process's resources (memory, files) but have their own execution path, enabling efficient parallel execution."
