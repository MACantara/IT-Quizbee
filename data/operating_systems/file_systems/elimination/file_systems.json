      "question": "What allocation method stores files in consecutive disk blocks?",
      "options": [
        "Linked allocation",
        "Contiguous allocation",
        "Indexed allocation",
        "Clustered allocation"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Contiguous allocation places file data in adjacent blocks. It provides fast access but suffers from external fragmentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What structure maps file names to metadata and locations?",
      "options": [
        "File allocation table",
        "Directory",
        "Inode table",
        "Superblock"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Directories maintain mappings from file names to file metadata. They organize the file system namespace hierarchy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tracks which disk blocks are available for allocation?",
      "options": [
        "Free space list",
        "Allocation table",
        "Block bitmap",
        "Both free space list and block bitmap"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Free space management uses either lists or bitmaps to track available blocks. Bitmaps are efficient for finding contiguous space."
    },
    {
      "question": "What disk scheduling algorithm serves requests in arrival order?",
      "options": [
        "SSTF",
        "SCAN",
        "FCFS",
        "LOOK"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "FCFS schedules disk requests in order received. It's fair but can have poor seek time performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What allocation method uses pointers to link file blocks?",
      "options": [
        "Contiguous allocation",
        "Linked allocation",
        "Indexed allocation",
        "Extent-based allocation"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Linked allocation chains file blocks together using pointers. It eliminates external fragmentation but random access is slow."
    },
    {
      "question": "What data structure in Unix stores file metadata?",
      "options": [
        "FCB",
        "Inode",
        "Dentry",
        "Superblock"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Inodes store file metadata like permissions, timestamps, and block locations. The file name is stored separately in directories."
    },
    {
      "question": "What disk scheduling minimizes seek time by choosing nearest request?",
      "options": [
        "FCFS",
        "SSTF",
        "SCAN",
        "C-SCAN"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Shortest Seek Time First selects the closest pending request. It improves throughput but can cause starvation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What allocation method uses a block containing pointers to data blocks?",
      "options": [
        "Contiguous allocation",
        "Linked allocation",
        "Indexed allocation",
        "FAT allocation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Indexed allocation stores all block pointers in an index block. It supports efficient random access without fragmentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What directory structure allows files to appear in multiple locations?",
      "options": [
        "Single-level directory",
        "Two-level directory",
        "Tree-structured directory",
        "Acyclic graph directory"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Acyclic graph directories support links, allowing files to be referenced from multiple locations. Cycles must be prevented."
    },
    {
      "question": "What disk scheduling sweeps back and forth serving requests?",
      "options": [
        "FCFS",
        "SSTF",
        "SCAN",
        "LIFO"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "SCAN moves the disk arm in one direction serving requests, then reverses. It's also called the elevator algorithm."
