    {
      "question": "What is the identity law for conjunction?",
      "answer": "p ∧ T ≡ p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The identity law for conjunction states that p ∧ T ≡ p. Combining any proposition with TRUE using AND preserves the original proposition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the domination law for disjunction?",
      "answer": "p ∨ T ≡ T",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The domination law for disjunction states that p ∨ T ≡ T. When you OR any proposition with TRUE, the result is always TRUE."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the idempotent law?",
      "answer": "p ∧ p ≡ p and p ∨ p ≡ p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The idempotent law states that p ∧ p ≡ p and p ∨ p ≡ p. Combining a proposition with itself using AND or OR gives the same proposition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the complement law?",
      "answer": "p ∧ ¬p ≡ F and p ∨ ¬p ≡ T",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The complement law states that p ∧ ¬p ≡ F (a proposition and its negation is always false) and p ∨ ¬p ≡ T (a proposition or its negation is always true)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the commutative law?",
      "answer": "p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p and p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The commutative law states that p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p and p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p. The order of operands doesn't matter for AND and OR operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the associative law?",
      "answer": "(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r) and (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The associative law allows regrouping: (p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r) and (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r). Parentheses can be moved without changing the result."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the distributive law for conjunction over disjunction?",
      "answer": "p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The distributive law for conjunction over disjunction states that p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r). AND distributes over OR."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the absorption law?",
      "answer": "p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p and p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The absorption law states that p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p and p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p. The proposition 'absorbs' the compound expression."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the negation of TRUE?",
      "answer": "FALSE",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "According to the negation laws, ¬T ≡ F and ¬F ≡ T. The negation of TRUE is FALSE."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which law allows you to factor out a common term from a disjunction?",
      "answer": "Distributive law",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The distributive law allows factoring: (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) ≡ p ∧ (q ∨ r). You can factor out the common p from both terms."
