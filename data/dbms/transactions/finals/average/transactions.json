    {
      "question": "When two transactions read the same data and one overwrites the other's changes without knowing.",
      "answer": "Lost update",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Lost update occurs when concurrent transactions both read then write, causing one update to be lost."
    },
    {
      "question": "When a transaction reads the same data twice and gets different results due to another transaction's update.",
      "answer": "Non-repeatable read",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Non-repeatable read happens when data changes between reads within the same transaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "When a transaction reads data that is later rolled back by another transaction.",
      "answer": "Dirty read",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Dirty read occurs when uncommitted changes from one transaction are visible to another."
    },
    {
      "question": "When new rows appear in a result set upon re-querying due to another transaction's inserts.",
      "answer": "Phantom read",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Phantom read happens when a transaction sees new rows that match a previously executed query."
    },
    {
      "question": "A lock that prevents others from reading or writing a data item.",
      "answer": "Exclusive lock",
      "alternatives": ["Write lock", "X-lock"],
      "explanation": "An exclusive lock, or write lock, grants exclusive access to the lock holder."
    },
    {
      "question": "A lock that allows others to read but not write a data item.",
      "answer": "Shared lock",
      "alternatives": ["Read lock", "S-lock"],
      "explanation": "A shared lock, or read lock, allows concurrent reads but prevents writes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Protocol requiring transactions to lock all needed data before execution begins.",
      "answer": "Two-phase locking",
      "alternatives": ["2PL"],
      "explanation": "Two-phase locking has a growing phase for acquiring locks and a shrinking phase for releasing them."
    },
    {
      "question": "The database log used to recover committed transactions after a failure.",
      "answer": "Write-ahead log",
      "alternatives": ["WAL"],
      "explanation": "Write-ahead log records changes before they're applied, enabling recovery and rollback."
    },
    {
      "question": "A situation where two or more transactions wait for each other to release locks.",
      "answer": "Deadlock",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Deadlock is a circular wait condition where transactions block each other indefinitely."
    },
    {
      "question": "A schedule where transactions execute without interleaving operations.",
      "answer": "Serial schedule",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Serial schedule executes transactions one after another with no concurrency."
