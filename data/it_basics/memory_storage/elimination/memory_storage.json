      "question": "What does RAM stand for?",
      "options": [
        "Random Access Memory",
        "Read Access Memory",
        "Rapid Application Memory",
        "Remote Access Module"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is the computer's primary memory used to temporarily store data and programs that are currently being used."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of memory is volatile?",
      "options": [
        "ROM",
        "RAM",
        "Hard Disk",
        "Flash Drive"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses all stored data when power is turned off. ROM and storage devices are non-volatile."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does SSD stand for?",
      "options": [
        "Solid State Device",
        "System Storage Disk",
        "Solid State Drive",
        "Standard Storage Device"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "SSD stands for Solid State Drive. It's a storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which storage device has the fastest data access speed?",
      "options": [
        "Hard Disk Drive (HDD)",
        "CD-ROM",
        "USB Flash Drive",
        "Solid State Drive (SSD)"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "SSDs have the fastest data access speeds because they have no moving parts and use flash memory, allowing for near-instant data retrieval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ROM primarily used for?",
      "options": [
        "Storing firmware and system boot instructions",
        "Temporary data storage",
        "Running applications",
        "Storing user documents"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "ROM (Read-Only Memory) is primarily used to store firmware and boot instructions that don't change, such as BIOS. It's non-volatile and typically cannot be modified."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many bytes are in 1 Kilobyte (KB)?",
      "options": [
        "1000 bytes",
        "1024 bytes",
        "100 bytes",
        "512 bytes"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "1 Kilobyte equals 1024 bytes. In computing, storage is measured in powers of 2 (2^10 = 1024), not powers of 10."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is cache memory?",
      "options": [
        "A type of permanent storage",
        "External storage device",
        "High-speed memory between CPU and RAM",
        "Virtual memory on hard disk"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Cache memory is extremely fast memory located between the CPU and RAM. It stores frequently accessed data to speed up processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which optical storage device has the largest capacity?",
      "options": [
        "CD (Compact Disc)",
        "DVD (Digital Versatile Disc)",
        "Floppy Disk",
        "Blu-ray Disc"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Blu-ray Disc has the largest capacity among optical storage devices, storing up to 25-50GB per layer, compared to DVD (4.7GB) and CD (700MB)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is virtual memory?",
      "options": [
        "Hard disk space used as temporary RAM when physical RAM is full",
        "Memory inside the CPU",
        "Cloud storage",
        "A type of ROM"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Virtual memory is a portion of hard disk space that the operating system uses as additional RAM when physical RAM is insufficient, though it's much slower."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is NOT a characteristic of Hard Disk Drives (HDD)?",
      "options": [
        "Uses magnetic platters to store data",
        "Has moving mechanical parts",
        "Generally cheaper than SSDs per GB",
        "Faster than SSDs"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "HDDs are NOT faster than SSDs. HDDs use spinning magnetic platters with moving read/write heads, making them slower than solid-state drives."
