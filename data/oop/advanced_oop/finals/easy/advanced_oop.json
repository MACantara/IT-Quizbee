    {
      "question": "What Python classes provide reusable functionality through multiple inheritance?",
      "answer": "Mixins",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Mixins are classes designed to add specific functionality to other classes without being standalone classes. They enable code reuse through multiple inheritance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Scala feature combines interface capabilities with concrete implementations?",
      "answer": "Traits",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Traits are similar to interfaces but can contain concrete method implementations. They provide reusable code that can be mixed into classes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are classes that control the creation and behavior of other classes?",
      "answer": "Metaclasses",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Metaclasses are classes whose instances are classes themselves. They define how classes behave and are created, with type being Python's default metaclass."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ability allows examining object types and attributes at runtime?",
      "answer": "Introspection",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Introspection enables programs to examine their own structure at runtime using functions like type(), dir(), hasattr(), and isinstance()."
    },
    {
      "question": "What capability extends introspection to modify program structure at runtime?",
      "answer": "Reflection",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Reflection allows examining and modifying classes, methods, and attributes dynamically at runtime. It goes beyond introspection by enabling modifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Python feature uses @ syntax to modify functions and classes?",
      "answer": "Decorators",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Decorators are functions that wrap other functions or classes to modify their behavior. They use @ syntax and enable adding functionality without changing original code."
    },
    {
      "question": "What programming technique involves writing code that generates or manipulates code?",
      "answer": "Metaprogramming",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Metaprogramming is creating programs that manipulate other programs or themselves. It includes decorators, metaclasses, code generation, and reflection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Python objects control attribute access through special methods?",
      "answer": "Descriptors",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Descriptors define __get__, __set__, and __delete__ methods to manage attribute access. Properties and many built-in features use the descriptor protocol."
    },
    {
      "question": "What method creates a new instance before __init__ is called?",
      "answer": "__new__",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "__new__ is a static method that creates and returns a new instance. It's called before __init__ and is crucial for metaclass programming and singleton patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Python module provides functions to examine live objects and their properties?",
      "answer": "inspect",
      "alternatives": ["Inspection module"],
      "explanation": "The inspect module offers functions like signature(), getmembers(), and getsource() to examine objects, classes, functions, and their attributes at runtime."
