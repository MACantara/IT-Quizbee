    {
      "question": "What is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers?",
      "answer": "Mean",
      "alternatives": [
        "Average",
        "Arithmetic mean"
      ],
      "explanation": "The mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the count. It's the most common measure of central tendency. For example, the mean of 2, 4, 6 is (2+4+6)/3 = 4. The mean is sensitive to outliers, which can pull it away from the typical value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the middle value when data is arranged in order?",
      "answer": "Median",
      "alternatives": [
        "Middle value"
      ],
      "explanation": "The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of data. For odd-sized datasets, it's the middle number; for even-sized, it's the average of the two middle numbers. The median is resistant to outliers, making it better than mean for skewed distributions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset?",
      "answer": "Mode",
      "alternatives": [
        "Modal value"
      ],
      "explanation": "The mode is the value that appears most often in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), multiple modes (bimodal, multimodal), or no mode if all values are unique. Mode is useful for categorical data where mean and median don't apply."
    },
    {
      "question": "What measures the likelihood of an event occurring?",
      "answer": "Probability",
      "alternatives": [
        "Chance"
      ],
      "explanation": "Probability quantifies the likelihood of events, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). Classical probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes. For example, the probability of rolling a 6 on a die is 1/6. Probability is fundamental to statistics, machine learning, and decision-making."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between the largest and smallest values?",
      "answer": "Range",
      "alternatives": [
        "Data range"
      ],
      "explanation": "Range is the simplest measure of dispersion, calculated as maximum minus minimum value. It gives a quick sense of data spread but is highly sensitive to outliers. For example, dataset [1, 3, 5, 7, 100] has range 99, dominated by the outlier 100."
    },
    {
      "question": "What graph uses bars to show frequency of different categories?",
      "answer": "Bar chart",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bar graph"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bar charts display categorical data using rectangular bars whose lengths represent values or frequencies. Each bar represents a category, and bars can be vertical or horizontal. Bar charts are ideal for comparing quantities across categories, like sales by product or population by country."
    },
    {
      "question": "What graph shows the distribution of numerical data using bins?",
      "answer": "Histogram",
      "alternatives": [
        "Frequency histogram"
      ],
      "explanation": "Histograms display continuous data distribution by dividing the range into intervals (bins) and showing frequency in each bin with bars. Unlike bar charts (for categories), histogram bars touch because they represent continuous ranges. Histograms reveal distribution shape, central tendency, and spread."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of distribution has data symmetrically centered around the mean?",
      "answer": "Normal distribution",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bell curve",
        "Gaussian distribution"
      ],
      "explanation": "Normal distribution is a symmetric, bell-shaped curve where data clusters around the mean. Many natural phenomena follow this pattern. In normal distribution, mean = median = mode, and about 68% of data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. It's foundational to many statistical methods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What measures the average squared deviation from the mean?",
      "answer": "Variance",
      "alternatives": [
        "Statistical variance"
      ],
      "explanation": "Variance measures data spread by averaging squared deviations from the mean. Squaring ensures positive values and emphasizes larger deviations. While variance is mathematically useful, its units are squared (e.g., meters²), making interpretation difficult. Standard deviation (square root of variance) is more interpretable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the square root of variance?",
      "answer": "Standard deviation",
      "alternatives": [
        "SD",
        "Std dev"
      ],
      "explanation": "Standard deviation measures typical distance of data points from the mean, in the same units as the data. It's the most common dispersion measure. Low standard deviation means data clusters near the mean; high standard deviation means data is spread out. In normal distributions, ±1 SD contains ~68% of data."
