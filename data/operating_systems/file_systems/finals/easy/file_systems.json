    {
      "question": "What is a named collection of related data stored on disk?",
      "answer": "File",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Files are basic storage units containing data or programs. They have names and attributes like size and permissions.",

      "question": "What structure organizes files into a hierarchy?",
      "answer": "Directory",
      "alternatives": [
        "Folder"
      ],
      "explanation": "Directories organize files into a tree structure. They map file names to their locations and metadata.",

    {
      "question": "What is the topmost directory in a file system hierarchy?",
      "answer": "Root directory",
      "alternatives": [
        "Root"
      ],
      "explanation": "The root directory sits at the top of the directory tree. All other directories are its descendants.",

    {
      "question": "What technique stores files in consecutive disk blocks?",
      "answer": "Contiguous allocation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Contiguous allocation places file blocks adjacently. It enables fast access but causes external fragmentation.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_e_finals_003"
    },
    {
      "question": "What allocation method chains blocks using pointers?",
      "answer": "Linked allocation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Linked allocation connects file blocks with pointers. It eliminates fragmentation but slows random access.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_e_finals_004"
    },
    {
      "question": "What allocation uses an index block containing all pointers?",
      "answer": "Indexed allocation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Indexed allocation stores pointers in a dedicated index block. It supports efficient direct access.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_e_finals_005"

      "question": "What Unix structure stores file metadata?",
      "answer": "Inode",
      "alternatives": [
        "Index node"
      ],
      "explanation": "Inodes contain file attributes, permissions, and block pointers. File names reside in directories.",

    {
      "question": "What directory entry creates an additional name for a file?",
      "answer": "Hard link",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Hard links provide multiple directory entries pointing to the same inode. They share file data and metadata.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_e_finals_007"

    {
      "question": "What reference points to another file's path?",
      "answer": "Symbolic link",
      "alternatives": [
        "Soft link",
        "Symlink"
      ],
      "explanation": "Symbolic links store paths to target files. They're separate files that redirect access.",

      "question": "What tracks free disk blocks using bits?",
      "answer": "Bitmap",
      "alternatives": [
        "Bit vector"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bitmaps use one bit per block to indicate availability. They're compact and efficient for finding free space.",
