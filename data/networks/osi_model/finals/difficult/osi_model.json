    {
      "question": "How many layers are in the OSI model?",
      "answer": "7 layers",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model has 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. It's a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication functions, helping design and troubleshoot networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which OSI layer is responsible for routing and logical addressing (IP addresses)?",
      "answer": "Network Layer (Layer 3)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for routing packets between networks using logical addresses (IP addresses). It determines the best path for data transmission, handles packet forwarding, and manages router operations. Common protocols include IP, ICMP, and routing protocols."
    },
    {
      "question": "At which OSI layer do switches primarily operate?",
      "answer": "Data Link Layer (Layer 2)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Switches primarily operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2), using MAC addresses to forward frames between devices within the same network. However, Layer 3 switches also exist, which can perform routing functions at the Network Layer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which layer is responsible for error detection and correction, and uses MAC addresses?",
      "answer": "Data Link Layer (Layer 2)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Data Link Layer (Layer 2) provides error detection and correction, frames data for transmission, and uses MAC (Media Access Control) addresses for device identification. It's divided into two sublayers: LLC (Logical Link Control) and MAC (Media Access Control)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the data unit called at the Transport Layer (Layer 4)?",
      "answer": "Segments (TCP) or Datagrams (UDP)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "At the Transport Layer (Layer 4), data units are called segments (for TCP) or datagrams (for UDP). This layer provides end-to-end communication, flow control, error recovery, and port-based addressing. TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication; UDP provides unreliable, connectionless communication."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which OSI layer handles data format translation, encryption, and compression?",
      "answer": "Presentation Layer (Layer 6)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Presentation Layer (Layer 6) handles data format translation, encryption/decryption, and compression/decompression. It ensures data from the application layer of one system is readable by the application layer of another system, acting as a translator between different data formats."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the Physical Layer (Layer 1)?",
      "answer": "Transmitting raw bits over physical media and defining hardware specifications",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Physical Layer (Layer 1) transmits raw binary data (bits) over physical transmission media. It defines hardware specifications including cables, connectors, voltage levels, data rates, and signal timing. Examples include Ethernet cables, fiber optics, and wireless radio frequencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which protocols operate at the Application Layer (Layer 7)?",
      "answer": "HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Application Layer (Layer 7) protocols include HTTP/HTTPS (web), FTP/SFTP (file transfer), SMTP/POP3/IMAP (email), DNS (name resolution), and many others. This layer provides network services directly to end-user applications and is closest to the user."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main purpose of the Session Layer (Layer 5)?",
      "answer": "To establish, manage, and terminate sessions between applications",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Session Layer (Layer 5) establishes, manages, and terminates sessions (connections) between applications. It handles dialog control (full-duplex or half-duplex), synchronization, and recovery of data exchange. Examples include NetBIOS and RPC."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the OSI model, which layer ensures reliable data transfer with flow control and error recovery?",
      "answer": "Transport Layer (Layer 4)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The Transport Layer (Layer 4) ensures reliable end-to-end data transfer through mechanisms like flow control, error recovery, and acknowledgments (when using TCP). It segments data from upper layers, manages retransmission of lost segments, and provides ordered delivery. TCP is connection-oriented and reliable; UDP is connectionless and unreliable."
