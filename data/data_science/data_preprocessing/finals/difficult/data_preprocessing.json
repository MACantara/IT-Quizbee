    {
      "question": "What advanced imputation uses machine learning to predict missing values?",
      "answer": "Multiple imputation",
      "alternatives": ["MICE", "Multivariate imputation"],
      "explanation": "Multiple imputation creates several plausible values for each missing entry."

      "answer": "Mahalanobis distance",
      "alternatives": ["Mahalanobis"],
      "explanation": "Mahalanobis distance accounts for correlation between variables."

      "question": "What method handles high-cardinality categorical features efficiently?",
      "answer": "Target encoding",
      "alternatives": ["Mean encoding", "Likelihood encoding"],
      "explanation": "Target encoding replaces categories with their target variable statistics."

    {
      "question": "What technique selects features based on statistical tests?",
      "answer": "Filter methods",
      "alternatives": ["Statistical feature selection"],
      "explanation": "Filter methods use correlation or chi-square tests for feature selection."

      "answer": "SMOTETomek",
      "alternatives": ["SMOTE Tomek", "Combined sampling"],
      "explanation": "SMOTETomek applies SMOTE then removes Tomek links."

    {
      "question": "What algorithm selects features by training models iteratively?",
      "answer": "Recursive Feature Elimination",
      "alternatives": ["RFE"],
      "explanation": "RFE recursively removes least important features."

    {
      "question": "What encoding preserves ordinal relationships in categories?",
      "answer": "Ordinal encoding",
      "alternatives": ["Ordered encoding"],
      "explanation": "Ordinal encoding maintains the natural order of categorical values."

    {
      "question": "What technique handles temporal dependencies in missing data?",
      "answer": "Forward fill",
      "alternatives": ["Forward filling", "ffill"],
      "explanation": "Forward fill propagates last valid observation forward in time series."
