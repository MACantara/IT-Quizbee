    {
      "question": "What does L3 cache typically refer to?",
      "answer": "Level 3 cache",
      "alternatives": [
        "L3",
        "Third level cache",
        "Shared cache"
      ],
      "explanation": "L3 cache is the third level of cache memory, typically shared among all CPU cores and larger but slower than L1 and L2.",

    {
      "question": "What is the principle that nearby data will likely be accessed together?",
      "answer": "Spatial locality",
      "alternatives": [
        "Locality of reference"
      ],
      "explanation": "Spatial locality describes the tendency to access data located near recently accessed memory locations.",

    {
      "question": "What cache mapping allows any block to be placed anywhere in cache?",
      "answer": "Fully associative",
      "alternatives": [
        "Fully associative mapping",
        "Full associative"
      ],
      "explanation": "Fully associative mapping provides maximum flexibility by allowing any memory block to map to any cache location.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What cache replacement policy removes the least recently used item?",
      "answer": "LRU",
      "alternatives": [
        "Least Recently Used"
      ],
      "explanation": "LRU replacement evicts the cache line that hasn't been accessed for the longest time, assuming it's least likely to be needed.",

      "question": "What technique uses disk space to extend available RAM?",
      "answer": "Virtual memory",
      "alternatives": [
        "Paging",
        "Swapping"
      ],
      "explanation": "Virtual memory uses hard disk space as an extension of RAM, allowing larger programs to run than physical memory would permit.",

      "question": "What is a page fault in virtual memory?",
      "answer": "Requested page not in physical memory",
      "alternatives": [
        "Page not in RAM",
        "Missing page"
      ],
      "explanation": "A page fault occurs when a program tries to access a page that isn't currently loaded in physical memory.",

    {
      "question": "What is the typical size of a cache line?",
      "answer": "64 bytes",
      "alternatives": [
        "64B",
        "64-byte"
      ],
      "explanation": "Modern processors typically use 64-byte cache lines, though this can vary by architecture.",

    {
      "question": "What does cache coherence ensure in multicore systems?",
      "answer": "Consistent view of memory across cores",
      "alternatives": [
        "Memory consistency",
        "Data consistency"
      ],
      "explanation": "Cache coherence protocols ensure all CPU cores have a consistent view of shared data in their caches.",

    {
      "question": "What is write-through cache policy?",
      "answer": "Write to cache and memory simultaneously",
      "alternatives": [
        "Simultaneous write",
        "Immediate write-back"
      ],
      "explanation": "Write-through immediately writes data to both cache and main memory, ensuring consistency but with performance overhead.",

      "question": "What memory type retains data without power?",
      "answer": "Non-volatile memory",
      "alternatives": [
        "Persistent memory",
        "ROM",
        "Flash memory"
      ],
      "explanation": "Non-volatile memory like ROM, flash, and SSDs retain their contents even when power is removed.",
