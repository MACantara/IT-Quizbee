    {
      "question": "What is a predicate in logic?",
      "answer": "A statement about a specific property or relation involving variables",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A predicate is a statement that describes a property of objects or a relation among objects. For example, P(x) might mean 'x is prime', where x is a variable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes predicate logic more powerful than propositional logic?",
      "answer": "It can express properties of individual objects and use quantifiers",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Predicate logic extends propositional logic by allowing us to express properties of individual objects, relations, and quantification (for all, there exists), making it more expressive."
    },
    {
      "question": "In P(x), what is x called?",
      "answer": "A variable",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "In P(x), x is a variable that can take values from a domain. P is the predicate that describes a property that x may or may not have."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a domain (or universe of discourse) in predicate logic?",
      "answer": "The set of values that variables can take",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The domain (or universe of discourse) is the set of all possible values that variables in predicates can take. For example, it might be all integers, all people, or all animals."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the predicate Loves(x, y), how many arguments does it have?",
      "answer": "Two (binary predicate)",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Loves(x, y) is a binary predicate because it takes two arguments. It describes a relationship between two objects: x loves y."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a free variable in predicate logic?",
      "answer": "A variable not bound by any quantifier",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A free variable is one that is not bound by any quantifier (∀ or ∃). Its value can vary freely within the domain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a bound variable?",
      "answer": "A variable within the scope of a quantifier",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A bound variable is one that appears within the scope of a quantifier (∀ or ∃). For example, in ∀x P(x), x is bound."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a well-formed formula (WFF) in predicate logic?",
      "answer": "A syntactically correct expression according to the rules of logic",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A well-formed formula (WFF) is a syntactically correct expression constructed according to the formation rules of predicate logic, regardless of whether it's true or false."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can predicates be nested in predicate logic?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can have predicates within predicates",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Yes, predicates can be nested and combined using logical operators. For example, P(x) ∧ Q(x) or ∀x (P(x) → Q(x)) are valid nested structures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic?",
      "answer": "First-order logic quantifies over individuals, not over predicates or functions",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "First-order logic (predicate logic) allows quantification only over individuals in the domain, not over predicates or functions themselves. Higher-order logic allows quantifying over predicates and functions."
