    {
      "question": "What is a named collection of related data stored on disk?",
      "answer": "File",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Files are basic storage units containing data or programs. They have names and attributes like size and permissions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What structure organizes files into a hierarchy?",
      "answer": "Directory",
      "alternatives": ["Folder"],
      "explanation": "Directories organize files into a tree structure. They map file names to their locations and metadata."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the topmost directory in a file system hierarchy?",
      "answer": "Root directory",
      "alternatives": ["Root"],
      "explanation": "The root directory sits at the top of the directory tree. All other directories are its descendants."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique stores files in consecutive disk blocks?",
      "answer": "Contiguous allocation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Contiguous allocation places file blocks adjacently. It enables fast access but causes external fragmentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What allocation method chains blocks using pointers?",
      "answer": "Linked allocation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Linked allocation connects file blocks with pointers. It eliminates fragmentation but slows random access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What allocation uses an index block containing all pointers?",
      "answer": "Indexed allocation",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Indexed allocation stores pointers in a dedicated index block. It supports efficient direct access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Unix structure stores file metadata?",
      "answer": "Inode",
      "alternatives": ["Index node"],
      "explanation": "Inodes contain file attributes, permissions, and block pointers. File names reside in directories."
    },
    {
      "question": "What directory entry creates an additional name for a file?",
      "answer": "Hard link",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Hard links provide multiple directory entries pointing to the same inode. They share file data and metadata."
    },
    {
      "question": "What reference points to another file's path?",
      "answer": "Symbolic link",
      "alternatives": ["Soft link", "Symlink"],
      "explanation": "Symbolic links store paths to target files. They're separate files that redirect access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tracks free disk blocks using bits?",
      "answer": "Bitmap",
      "alternatives": ["Bit vector"],
      "explanation": "Bitmaps use one bit per block to indicate availability. They're compact and efficient for finding free space."
