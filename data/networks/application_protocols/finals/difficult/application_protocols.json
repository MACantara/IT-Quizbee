    {
      "question": "Which protocol is used for transferring web pages over the internet?",
      "answer": "HTTP/HTTPS",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and its secure version HTTPS are used for transferring web pages and resources between web servers and clients (browsers). HTTPS adds encryption using SSL/TLS for secure communication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the default port number for HTTPS?",
      "answer": "443",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Port 443 is the default port for HTTPS (secure HTTP). Port 80 is used for standard HTTP, port 8080 is an alternative HTTP port, and port 21 is used for FTP. HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS protocols."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which protocol is primarily used for sending emails?",
      "answer": "SMTP",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for sending emails from clients to servers and between mail servers. POP3 and IMAP are used for retrieving emails from servers. SMTP operates on port 25 (or 587 for submission)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between POP3 and IMAP email protocols?",
      "answer": "POP3 downloads emails and typically deletes them from server; IMAP keeps emails on server for synchronization",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) downloads emails to the client and typically deletes them from the server, while IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) keeps emails on the server, allowing synchronization across multiple devices. IMAP is better for accessing email from multiple locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which protocol is used for secure file transfer with encryption?",
      "answer": "SFTP or FTPS",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure) provide encrypted file transfer. SFTP uses SSH for encryption, while FTPS adds SSL/TLS to standard FTP. Regular FTP transmits data in plaintext and is not secure for sensitive information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does DNS (Domain Name System) do?",
      "answer": "Translates domain names to IP addresses",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on networks. It acts as the internet's phone book, making web navigation user-friendly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which protocol provides remote command-line access with encryption?",
      "answer": "SSH",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SSH (Secure Shell) provides encrypted remote command-line access and secure network services. It replaced Telnet, which transmits data in plaintext. SSH uses port 22 and provides authentication, encryption, and data integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?",
      "answer": "To automatically assign IP addresses and network configuration to devices",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters (subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers) to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual IP configuration and enables efficient IP address management."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which application layer protocol uses port 53?",
      "answer": "DNS",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "DNS (Domain Name System) uses port 53 for both UDP and TCP protocols. UDP is typically used for standard DNS queries, while TCP is used for zone transfers and queries that exceed 512 bytes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)?",
      "answer": "Monitoring and managing network devices",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "SNMP is used for monitoring and managing network devices like routers, switches, servers, and printers. It allows administrators to collect information about network performance, detect problems, and configure devices remotely. SNMP operates on ports 161 and 162."
