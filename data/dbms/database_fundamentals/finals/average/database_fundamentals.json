    {
      "question": "What is a database?",
      "answer": "An organized collection of structured data stored electronically",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system. It's managed by a Database Management System (DBMS), which provides efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data while ensuring data integrity, security, and concurrent access."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does DBMS stand for?",
      "answer": "Database Management System",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "DBMS stands for Database Management System - software that interacts with users, applications, and the database itself to capture, manage, and retrieve data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MongoDB. DBMS provides data security, integrity, backup, and recovery capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between data and information?",
      "answer": "Data is raw facts; information is processed data that has meaning and context",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Data consists of raw, unprocessed facts and figures (e.g., '25', 'John'). Information is data that has been processed, organized, and given context to become meaningful (e.g., 'John is 25 years old'). Databases store data that is transformed into information through queries and analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is an advantage of using a database over file systems?",
      "answer": "Data redundancy reduction, data integrity, concurrent access control, and security",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Databases offer multiple advantages: reduced data redundancy, enforced data integrity through constraints, controlled concurrent access, better security, data independence, efficient data retrieval, backup and recovery mechanisms, and standardized data access through SQL. File systems lack these sophisticated features."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is data redundancy?",
      "answer": "Unnecessary duplication of data in multiple locations",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Data redundancy refers to unnecessary duplication of data in multiple locations. While controlled redundancy can be beneficial (backups, caching), uncontrolled redundancy wastes storage, causes inconsistencies, complicates updates, and leads to anomalies. Database normalization reduces harmful redundancy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is data integrity?",
      "answer": "The accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Data integrity ensures data accuracy, consistency, and reliability throughout its lifecycle. It's maintained through constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints), data types, validation rules, and transactions. Types include entity integrity, referential integrity, domain integrity, and user-defined integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main types of database models?",
      "answer": "Relational, hierarchical, network, object-oriented, and NoSQL",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Main database models include: Relational (tables with rows and columns, SQL databases), Hierarchical (tree structure), Network (graph structure), Object-Oriented (objects with properties and methods), and NoSQL (document, key-value, column-family, graph). Each suits different use cases and data structures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a schema in database terminology?",
      "answer": "The logical structure and organization of the database",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A database schema defines the logical structure and organization of the database - how data is organized, relationships between tables, data types, constraints, and views. It's like a blueprint. Schemas can be conceptual (high-level design), logical (detailed structure), or physical (how data is stored on disk)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of a Database Administrator (DBA)?",
      "answer": "To manage, maintain, secure, and optimize database systems",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A DBA manages, maintains, secures, and optimizes database systems. Responsibilities include installation, configuration, backup and recovery, performance tuning, security management, user access control, monitoring, capacity planning, and troubleshooting. DBAs ensure database availability, reliability, and efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is metadata in databases?",
      "answer": "Data about data",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Metadata is 'data about data' - it describes the structure, constraints, and characteristics of data in the database. Examples include table names, column names, data types, lengths, constraints, indexes, and relationships. Metadata is stored in the data dictionary or system catalog and helps DBMS manage data effectively."
