    {
      "question": "What disk scheduling serves the closest request first?",
      "answer": "SSTF",
      "alternatives": [
        "Shortest Seek Time First"
      ],
      "explanation": "SSTF minimizes seek time by choosing the nearest request. It improves throughput but can starve distant requests.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_000"
    },
    {
      "question": "What disk scheduling sweeps in one direction then reverses?",
      "answer": "SCAN",
      "alternatives": [
        "Elevator algorithm"
      ],
      "explanation": "SCAN moves the arm to one end serving requests, then reverses. It provides fair access without starvation.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_001"
    },
    {
      "question": "What scheduling variant only goes to the last request?",
      "answer": "LOOK",
      "alternatives": [
        "C-LOOK"
      ],
      "explanation": "LOOK reverses direction at the last request instead of the disk end. It reduces unnecessary head movement.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_002"
    },
    {
      "question": "What file system stores metadata in a central table?",
      "answer": "FAT",
      "alternatives": [
        "File Allocation Table"
      ],
      "explanation": "FAT uses a table with entries for each disk block. It's simple but the table can become large.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_003"
    },
    {
      "question": "What allocation groups blocks into variable-sized contiguous regions?",
      "answer": "Extent-based allocation",
      "alternatives": [
        "Extent allocation"
      ],
      "explanation": "Extent-based allocation uses contiguous block runs. It reduces metadata overhead for large files.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_004"
    },
    {
      "question": "What special directory entry points to the current directory?",
      "answer": "Dot entry",
      "alternatives": [
        "Period entry",
        "Current directory entry"
      ],
      "explanation": "The dot entry allows referencing the current directory. Most file systems include it automatically.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_005"
    },
    {
      "question": "What entry points to the parent directory?",
      "answer": "Dot-dot entry",
      "alternatives": [
        "Double dot entry",
        "Parent directory entry"
      ],
      "explanation": "The dot-dot entry references the parent directory. It enables upward navigation in the tree.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_006"
    },
    {
      "question": "What stores file system parameters and state?",
      "answer": "Superblock",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "The superblock contains file system metadata like block size, free block count, and inode locations. It's critical for mounting.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_007"
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique writes changes immediately to disk?",
      "answer": "Synchronous write",
      "alternatives": [
        "Sync write"
      ],
      "explanation": "Synchronous writes ensure data reaches disk before continuing. They provide durability but reduce performance.",
      "id": "fil_sys_fil_sys_a_finals_008"
    },
    {
      "question": "What temporarily stores modified file system data in memory?",
      "answer": "Buffer cache",
      "alternatives": [
        "Page cache"
      ],
      "explanation": "Buffer caches hold recently accessed disk blocks in RAM. They improve performance through read and write caching.",
