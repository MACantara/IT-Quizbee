      "question": "What is malware?",
      "answer": "Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or compromise computer systems",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage, steal data, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt computer operations. Types include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and rootkits. Malware is distributed through phishing emails, infected websites, malicious downloads, and compromised software."

    {
      "question": "What is a virus in computer security?",
      "answer": "Malicious code that attaches to files and replicates when the host file is executed",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A computer virus is malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate files or programs (host). When the infected file is executed, the virus activates, replicates itself by infecting other files, and may perform harmful actions (deleting files, stealing data, corrupting systems). Unlike worms, viruses require human action (running an infected program) to spread."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a worm in cybersecurity?",
      "answer": "Self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks without user action",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A worm is self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks by exploiting vulnerabilities, without requiring human interaction. Unlike viruses, worms don't need to attach to host files. Famous examples include the Morris Worm (1988), Blaster, and WannaCry. Worms can consume bandwidth, install backdoors, or carry other malicious payloads, causing widespread damage quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ransomware?",
      "answer": "Malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Ransomware is malware that encrypts victim's files or locks their system, then demands payment (usually cryptocurrency) to restore access. Variants include crypto-ransomware (encrypts files) and locker ransomware (locks system access). Notable examples: WannaCry, CryptoLocker, Petya. Prevention includes backups, updated software, user training, and not paying ransoms (no guarantee of recovery)."

    {
      "question": "What is phishing?",
      "answer": "A social engineering attack using fraudulent communications to steal sensitive information",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (banks, companies, government) through email, text (smishing), or voice (vishing) to trick victims into revealing passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive data. Phishing emails often contain malicious links or attachments. Spear phishing targets specific individuals; whaling targets high-profile victims like executives."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack?",
      "answer": "Overwhelming a system with traffic from multiple sources to make it unavailable",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A DDoS attack floods a target (website, server, network) with massive amounts of traffic from multiple sources (botnet of compromised devices), overwhelming it and making it unavailable to legitimate users. Unlike simple DoS attacks from one source, DDoS uses distributed sources, making it harder to block. Motivations include extortion, competition sabotage, activism, or distraction from other attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a trojan horse in cybersecurity?",
      "answer": "Malware disguised as legitimate software that tricks users into installing it",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A trojan horse (or trojan) is malware disguised as legitimate, useful software. Unlike viruses and worms, trojans don't self-replicate. Users are tricked into downloading and executing them. Once active, trojans can steal data, install backdoors, download additional malware, or give attackers remote access. Common disguises include free software, games, or email attachments. Named after the Greek myth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is social engineering in cybersecurity?",
      "answer": "Manipulating people into divulging confidential information or performing actions",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Social engineering exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities to manipulate people into breaking security procedures. Techniques include phishing, pretexting (fabricating scenarios), baiting (offering something enticing), tailgating (following authorized persons), and impersonation. Attackers exploit trust, fear, curiosity, or urgency. Training users to recognize these tactics is crucial for defense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a zero-day vulnerability?",
      "answer": "A security flaw unknown to the software vendor that has no patch available",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "A zero-day vulnerability is a software flaw that is unknown to the vendor or has no patch available yet. 'Zero-day' refers to the vendor having zero days to fix it before it's exploited. Zero-day exploits are valuable because there's no defense available. They're discovered by security researchers (reported responsibly) or malicious actors (sold on black markets or used in attacks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is spyware?",
      "answer": "Malware that secretly monitors user activity and collects personal information",
      "alternatives": [],
      "explanation": "Spyware is malware that secretly monitors user activity and collects information without consent. It can track browsing habits, log keystrokes (keyloggers), capture screenshots, access webcams/microphones, and steal credentials or sensitive data. Often bundled with free software or installed via trojans. Spyware can significantly slow system performance and violate privacy. Anti-spyware tools and careful download practices help prevent it."
